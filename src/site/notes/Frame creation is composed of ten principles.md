# Frame creation is composed of ten principles

The [[Frame creation resolves complex problems in nine steps\|nine step process]] of frame creation is useful, but prescriptive and not always easy to apply. Dorst lists ten core principles depict the frame creation approach to problem-solving.[^1]

**General Principles:**

1. **Attack the context** – [[Solutions to complex problems are rooted in context\|Solutions to complex problems are rooted in context]]
2. **Suspend judgment** – [[Appraisal of a complex problem’s context is objective\|Appraisal of a complex problem’s context is objective]]
3. **Embrace complexity** – [[Solving complex problems avoids simplification\|Solving complex problems avoids simplification]]
4. **Zoom out, expand, and concentrate** – [[Solving complex problems requires understanding the context\|Solving complex problems requires understanding the context]]

**Essential Quality in Each Stage:**

5. **Search for patterns** – [[Solutions to complex problems are based on pattern recognition\|Solutions to complex problems are based on pattern recognition]]
6. **Deepen themes** – [[Solutions to complex problems depend on creation of themes\|Solutions to complex problems depend on creation of themes]]
7. **Sharpen the frames** – [[Solutions to complex problems depends on a clear frame\|Solutions to complex problems depends on a clear frame]]

**Application Strategies:**

8. **Be prepared** – [[Solving complex problems requires laying considerable groundwork\|Solving complex problems requires laying considerable groundwork]]
9. **Create the moment** – [[Solving complex problems requires having the right participants\|Solving complex problems requires having the right participants]]
10. **Follow through** – [[Solving complex problems requires intentional follow-through\|Solving complex problems requires intentional follow-through]]
