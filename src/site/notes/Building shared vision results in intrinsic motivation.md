# Building shared vision results in intrinsic motivation

Leaders of high performance teams translate personal vision into a shared vision owned by the team. This creates the context in which [[Shared consciousness maximizes availability of strategic information\|shared consciousness]] can flourish and [[Smart autonomy is freedom to act according to strategic intent\|smart autonomy]] results in collaborative creation of solutions to complex challenges.

> ==When there is a genuine vision (as opposed to the all-too-familiar “vision statement”), people excel and learn, not because they are told to, but because they want to.== But many leaders have personal visions that never get translated into shared visions that galvanize an organization.[^1]
