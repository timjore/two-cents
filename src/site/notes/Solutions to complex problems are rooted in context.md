# Solutions to complex problems are rooted in context

The most effective way to discover a solution to a complex problem is to deeply understand the problem itself.

> ==The key principle of frame creation lies in **its approach to a problem situation**==. Expert designers have shown us that open, complex, dynamic, and networked problems often cannot be solved directly, at least not in the terms in which they are presented. ==The problem and its formulation have their roots in **a specific context that needs to be critically appraised and altered** before the problem itself can be attacked.==[^1]
