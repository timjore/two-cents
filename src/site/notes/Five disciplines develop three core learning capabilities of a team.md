# Five disciplines develop three core learning capabilities of a team

The fundamental unit of learning in an organization is a working team. Effective teams excel at the **Core Learning Capabilities of a Team:**[^1]

| **Aspiration**                          | **Reflective Conversation**     | **Understanding Complexity** |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1- Personal Mastery<br>2- Shared Vision | 3- Mental Models<br>4- Dialogue | 5- Systems Thinking          |[^1]

> ==The five disciplines represent approaches (theories and methods) for developing three core learning capabilities: fostering aspiration, developing reflective conversation, and understanding complexity.== Building on an idea from the original book, that ==the **fundamental learning units in an organization are working teams** (people who need one another to produce an outcome)==, we came to refer to these as the “core learning capabilities of teams” and symbolically represented them as a three-legged stool, to visually convey the importance of each—the stool would not stand if any of the three were missing.[^2]
