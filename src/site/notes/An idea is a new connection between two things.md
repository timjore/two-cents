# An idea is a new connection between two things

> As we’ve said, ==**an idea is simply a new connection between two things** that were already floating around in your head==. When you give your brain a problem to solve, it goes to work, way in the background, by jamming disparate pieces of knowledge and experience together in different ways until a light bulb goes off. “Does this work?” Maybe, maybe not, but you don’t want to cut off the flow of ideas yet, so you say: “Good job, brain! What else have you got?”[^1]
