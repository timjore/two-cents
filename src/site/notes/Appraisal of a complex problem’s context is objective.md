# Appraisal of a complex problem’s context is objective

Frame creation begins with seeking to [[Solutions to complex problems are rooted in context\|understand the problem context]], which includes the history and assumptions of those who own the problem. But this process of discovery must suspend judgment, in order to retain an objective posture.

> The frame creation process is aimed at opening new avenues and opportunities to get around an intractable situation. It circles the history and assumptions behind the rationalities that have led to the original problem formulation, as the problem-solving capacity of these rationalities has obviously been exhausted. While ==this is a critical process, it is certainly not intended to critique the stakeholders== for lack of insight or to punish “bad” behavior. Within a frame creation process, ==the **practices of the problem owner and the other stakeholders** should just be taken as givens==, which must be either worked with or worked around.[^1]
