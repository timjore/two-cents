# Developing problem situations allows reframing

Design practice can be thought of as the coevolution of problem and solution, in that “==expert design practices have as much to do with **reformulating the problem** as with the generation of suitable solutions.==”[^1] In this regard, Dorst notes that the [[Design Thinking is innovating routinely\|Design Thinking]] movement—which depends on the ability of designers to *generate solutions*—may be misleading to the extent it does not also take into account the need to reformulate the problem space as well. “If we want to learn from expert designers, we need to follow their example and ==shift our attention to the study of problem-related knowledge, skills, and strategies.==”[^2]

Thus, expert designers **develop problem situations** in order to attain a creative event that bridges problem and solution.

> ==Designers use [[Metaphors form the basis of our ability to think\|metaphor]], contextual engagement, and conjecture to “destructure” the problem situation along with their clients to allow reframing to occur.== “Mood board” discussions constitute one method designers use to invoke metaphors and analogies. These mood boards assist in creating a more open conversation about a project, as they use abstract images that do not immediately prefigure particular solutions.[^3]

One approach to shifting the definition of the problem is by highlighting a future context.[^4]

1. Critically weigh the assumptions that lie behind the initial brief. To be able to create newness, ==the designer has to know **the thought process that led to the design of current products** and to the current problem situation==. 
2. Question the importance of those fundamental variables and their current state. 
3. Create an image of the future context as it will develop. 
4. The design process can begin, creating an outcome that will suit the future context.
