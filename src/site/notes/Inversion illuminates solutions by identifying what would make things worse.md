# Inversion illuminates solutions by identifying what would make things worse

When attempting to develop an innovative solution to a complex problem, it can be helpful to invert the ideation and attempt to determine what would make the problem worse. The opposite of what worsens the problem may suggest an effective way toward solving it. The steps to follow:[^1]

1. Identify what actions or factors would make the problem worse.
2. Determine why these would worsen the problem.
3. Invert the factors and consider how they might suggest a solution to the problem.
