# Resilience is the distance between the system and its nearest threshold

A system is in its most stable state when it is equally distant from all thresholds that, if crossed, would lead to a different stable state (or regime).

> One of the central ideas of resilience thinking is that ==social-ecological systems have **multiple regimes** (stable states) that are **separated by thresholds**.== The metaphor connected with this model is a ball in a basin … The ball is the current state of the social-ecological system, and the basin is the set of possible states the system can be in and still have the same structure and function. ==Beyond some limit (the edge of the basin), the feedbacks that drive the system change and **the system tends toward a different equilibrium**.== The system in this new basin has a different structure and function. The system (the ball) is said to have crossed a threshold into a new basin of attraction. In this metaphor, ==**resilience is all about the distance between the ball and the edge (threshold) of the basin**, and the **size and shape of the basin of attraction**==.[^1]
