# Negativity Instinct hinders thinking by emphasizing bad news

from *[[References/Factfulness – Rosling, et al. (2018)\|Factfulness]]*:

> Factfulness is … recognizing when we get negative news, and remembering that ==**information about bad events is much more likely to reach us.** When things are getting better we often don’t hear about them.== This gives us a systematically too-negative impression of the world around us, which is very stressful.

To control the negativity instinct, **expect bad news**.

- **Better and bad.** Practice distinguishing between a level (e.g., bad) and a direction of change (e.g., better). Convince yourself that **things can be both better and bad**.

- **Good news is not news.** Good news is almost never reported. So news is almost always bad. When you see bad news, ask whether equally positive news would have reached you.

- **Gradual improvement is not news.** When a trend is gradually improving, with periodic dips, you are more likely to notice the dips than the overall improvement.

- **More news does not equal more suffering.** More bad news is sometimes due to better surveillance of suffering, not a worsening world.

- **Beware of rosy pasts.** People often glorify their early experiences, and nations often glorify their histories.
