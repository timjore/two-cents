# Perseverance balances faith and honesty

Overcoming adverse circumstances involves simultaneously never losing hope that things will get better while also facing the brutal reality that the hoped-for outcome will not be easy or immediate. James Stockdale exemplified this in “Hanoi Hilton” Prisoner of War camp during the Vietnam war:

> Stockdale understood that two groups of POWs were at risk: those who were overly optimistic (“We’ll be out by Christmas!”) and those who had lost hope (“We will never get out alive.”)… ==By **balancing faith and optimism with brutal honesty about their dire straits**==, Stockdale positioned the Hanoi Hilton inmates to do the seemingly impossible: to defeat their captors’ attempts to use them for propaganda and to return home as a team, without abandoning each other or their values.[^1]
