# Strategy identifies management systems needed for winning

In order for the team to ensure that the capabilities they are employing to implement their winning aspiration in their selected competitive field, they need purposefully designed systems that empower them to achieve it and track their progress along the way.

> The final strategic choice in the cascade focuses on management systems. These are the ==systems that **foster, support, and measure** the strategy. To be truly effective, they must be **purposefully designed** to support the choices and capabilities==. The types of systems and measures will vary from choice to choice, capability to capability, and company to company. In general, though, the systems need to ensure that choices are communicated to the whole company, employees are trained to deliver on choices and leverage capabilities, plans are made to invest in and sustain capabilities over time, and the efficacy of the choices and progress toward aspirations are measured.[^1]
