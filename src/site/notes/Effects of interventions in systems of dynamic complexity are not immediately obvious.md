# Effects of interventions in systems of dynamic complexity are not immediately obvious

Traditional approaches to strategic planning and management are designed to handle “detail complexity”—where variables are many, but knowable, and the systems itself may be complicated, but still causal. Dynamic complexity is entirely different.

> The second type is dynamic complexity, situations where cause and effect are subtle, and where ==the **effects over time of interventions are not obvious**==. ==Conventional forecasting, planning, and analysis methods are not equipped to deal with dynamic complexity.== Following a complex set of instructions to assemble a machine involves detail complexity, as does taking inventory in a discount retail store. But none of these situations is especially complex dynamically.[^1]
