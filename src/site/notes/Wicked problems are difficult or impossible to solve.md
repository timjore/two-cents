# Wicked problems are difficult or impossible to solve

A wicked problem is a term used to describe a complex and difficult-to-solve social or societal issue that is ==characterized by a **lack of clear definition**, multiple **interdependent variables**, and a **lack of clear solutions**==.[^1] These problems are often the result of the interactions between many different factors and systems, and involve multiple stakeholders with differing values and priorities. As a result, they are difficult to define, measure, and solve.


A wicked problem is a “social or cultural problem that is difficult or impossible to solve for as many as four reasons: 
- incomplete or contradictory **knowledge**, 
- the number of **people and opinions** involved, 
- the **large economic burden**, and 
- the **interconnected nature** of these problems with *other* problems.“^[2]

A wicked problem is “rife with uncertainty, and outside of previous experience, where demanding more data actually became the problem itself.“^[[[Range – Epstein (2019)\|[Range – Epstein (2019)]]] This connects to the concept of [[Kind vs. Wicked Learning Environments\|Kind vs. Wicked Learning Environments]], where a “wicked learning” environment makes learning from previous scenarios impossible, and possibly problematic.

The difference between “wicked” and “hard but ordinary” problems:^[3]

1. **There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem.** It’s ==not possible to write a well-defined statement of the problem==, as can be done with an ordinary problem.

2. **Wicked problems have no stopping rule.** You can tell when you’ve reached a solution with an ordinary problem. With a wicked problem, ==the search for solutions never stops==.

3. **Solutions to wicked problems are not true or false, but good or bad.** Ordinary problems have solutions that can be objectively evaluated as right or wrong. ==Choosing a solution to a wicked problem is largely a matter of judgment.==

4. **There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem.** It’s possible to determine right away if a solution to an ordinary problem is working. But ==solutions to wicked problems generate unexpected consequences over time==, making it difficult to measure their effectiveness.

5. **Every solution to a wicked problem is a “one-shot” operation; because there is no opportunity to learn by trial and error, every attempt counts significantly.** Solutions to ordinary problems can be easily tried and abandoned. With wicked problems, ==every implemented solution has consequences that cannot be undone==.

6. **Wicked problems ==do not have an exhaustively describable set of potential solutions==, nor is there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan.**

7. **Every wicked problem is essentially unique.** An ordinary problem belongs to a class of similar problems that are all solved in the same way. A wicked problem is substantially without precedent; ==experience does not help you address it==.

8. **Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem.** While an ordinary problem is self-contained, ==a wicked problem is entwined with other problems==.

9. **The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways.** A wicked problem involves many stakeholders, who all will have different ideas about what the problem really is and what its causes are.

10. **The planner has no right to be wrong.** Problem solvers dealing with a wicked issue are held liable for the consequences of any actions they take, because those actions will have such a large impact and are hard to justify.
