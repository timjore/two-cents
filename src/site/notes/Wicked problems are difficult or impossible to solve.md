# Wicked problems are difficult or impossible to solve

A wicked problem is a term used to describe a complex and difficult-to-solve social or societal issue that is ==characterized by a **lack of clear definition**, multiple **interdependent variables**, and a **lack of clear solutions**==. These problems are often the result of the interactions between many different factors and systems, and involve multiple stakeholders with differing values and priorities. As a result, they are difficult to define, measure, and solve.

Solving a wicked problem requires a systemic approach that takes into account the interrelatedness of the problem, and involve a diverse set of stakeholders in the problem solving process. Additionally, it often requires a long-term perspective, as well as the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Wicked problems can not be solved once and for all, but rather need to be managed over time.

The term "wicked problem" was first coined by Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber in the 1970s to describe the challenges of urban planning. They argued that traditional problem-solving methods were not effective in addressing these types of problems because they involve multiple perspectives, are constantly evolving, and are difficult to fully understand. Examples of wicked problems include issues such as poverty, climate change, and healthcare. 

> ==The kinds of problems that planners deal with-societal problems-are inherently different from the problems that scientists and perhaps some classes of engineers deal with. **Planning problems are inherently wicked**.==[^1]

A wicked problem is a “social or cultural problem that is difficult or impossible to solve for as many as four reasons: 
- incomplete or contradictory **knowledge**, 
- the number of **people and opinions** involved, 
- the **large economic burden**, and 
- the **interconnected nature** of these problems with *other* problems.“^[Kolko, Jon. “Wicked Problems: Problems Worth Solving.” Stanford Social Innovation Review, March 6, 2012. [https://ssir.org/books/excerpts/entry/wicked_problems_problems_worth_solving](https://ssir.org/books/excerpts/entry/wicked_problems_problems_worth_solving).]

A wicked problem is “rife with uncertainty, and outside of previous experience, where demanding more data actually became the problem itself.“^[[[Range – Epstein (2019)\|[Range – Epstein (2019)]]] This connects to the concept of [[Kind vs. Wicked Learning Environments\|Kind vs. Wicked Learning Environments]], where a “wicked learning” environment makes learning from previous scenarios impossible, and possibly problematic.

The difference between “wicked” and “hard but ordinary” problems:^[Camillus, John C. “Strategy as a Wicked Problem.” _Harvard Business Review_, May 1, 2008. [https://hbr.org/2008/05/strategy-as-a-wicked-problem](https://hbr.org/2008/05/strategy-as-a-wicked-problem).]

1. **There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem.** It’s ==not possible to write a well-defined statement of the problem==, as can be done with an ordinary problem.

2. **Wicked problems have no stopping rule.** You can tell when you’ve reached a solution with an ordinary problem. With a wicked problem, ==the search for solutions never stops==.

3. **Solutions to wicked problems are not true or false, but good or bad.** Ordinary problems have solutions that can be objectively evaluated as right or wrong. ==Choosing a solution to a wicked problem is largely a matter of judgment.==

4. **There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem.** It’s possible to determine right away if a solution to an ordinary problem is working. But ==solutions to wicked problems generate unexpected consequences over time==, making it difficult to measure their effectiveness.

5. **Every solution to a wicked problem is a “one-shot” operation; because there is no opportunity to learn by trial and error, every attempt counts significantly.** Solutions to ordinary problems can be easily tried and abandoned. With wicked problems, ==every implemented solution has consequences that cannot be undone==.

6. **Wicked problems ==do not have an exhaustively describable set of potential solutions==, nor is there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan.**

7. **Every wicked problem is essentially unique.** An ordinary problem belongs to a class of similar problems that are all solved in the same way. A wicked problem is substantially without precedent; ==experience does not help you address it==.

8. **Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem.** While an ordinary problem is self-contained, ==a wicked problem is entwined with other problems==.

9. **The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways.** A wicked problem involves many stakeholders, who all will have different ideas about what the problem really is and what its causes are.

10. **The planner has no right to be wrong.** Problem solvers dealing with a wicked issue are held liable for the consequences of any actions they take, because those actions will have such a large impact and are hard to justify.
