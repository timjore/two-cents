# Perceived impartiality increases influence

If an expert is perceived to have “a horse in the race” (a vested interest in the outcome for which they are advocating), their influence decreases. If an expert is perceived as being impartial (i.e., “just the facts”), their influence increases.

> ==**We allow ourselves to be swayed more by experts who seem to be impartial** than by those who have something to gain by convincing us==; research has shown this to be true around the world and in children as young as second-graders. By wondering how an expert stands to benefit from our compliance, we give ourselves another shield against undue and automatic influence. Even knowledgeable authorities in a field will not persuade us until we are satisfied their messages represent the facts faithfully.[^1]
