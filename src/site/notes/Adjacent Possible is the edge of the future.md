# Adjacent Possible is the edge of the future

The shadow future, comprised of the set of **all first-order combinations** (i.e., next steps, immediate opportunities) **that are possible from the present state of things**. It is the map of all the ways in which the present can change, and the map grows as its boundaries are explored. Each new combination expands the number of connected possibilities.

> The scientist Stuart Kauffman has a suggestive name for ==**the set of all those first-order combinations**: “the adjacent possible.”== **The phrase captures both the limits and the creative potential of change and [[innovation\|innovation]].** In the case of prebiotic chemistry, the adjacent possible defines all those molecular reactions that were directly achievable in the primordial soup. Sunflowers and mosquitoes and brains exist outside that circle of possibility. ==The adjacent possible is a kind of shadow future, hovering on the edges of the present state of things, a map of all the ways in which the present can reinvent itself.== Yet is it not an infinite space, or a totally open playing field. The number of potential first-order reactions is vast, but it is a finite number, and it excludes most of the forms that now populate the biosphere. What the adjacent possible tells us is that **at any moment the world is capable of extraordinary change, but only certain changes can happen.**

> ==The strange and beautiful truth about the adjacent possible is that **its boundaries grow as you explore those boundaries**. Each new combination ushers new combinations into the adjacent possible.== Think of it as a house that magically expands with each door you open. You begin in a room with four doors, each leading to a new room that you haven’t visited yet. Those four rooms are the adjacent possible. But once you open one of those doors and stroll into that room, three new doors appear, each leading to a brand-new room that you couldn’t have reached from your original starting point.[^1]
