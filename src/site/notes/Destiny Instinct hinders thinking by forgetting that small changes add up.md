# Destiny Instinct hinders thinking by forgetting that small changes add up

from *[[References/Factfulness – Rosling, et al. (2018)\|Factfulness]]*:

> Factfulness is … recognizing that many things (including people, countries, religions, and cultures) appear to be constant \[i.e., “it is our destiny”\] just because the change is happening slowly, and remembering that **even ==small, slow changes gradually add up== to big changes**.

To control the destiny instinct, remember ==slow change is still change==.

- **Keep track of gradual improvements.** A small change every year can translate to a huge change over decades.

- **Update your knowledge.** Some knowledge goes out of date quickly. Technology, countries, societies, cultures, and religions are constantly changing.

- **Talk to Grandpa.** If you want to be reminded of how values have changed, think about your grandparents’ values and how they differ from yours.

- **Collect examples of cultural change.** Challenge the idea that today’s culture must also have been yesterday’s, and will also be tomorrow’s.
