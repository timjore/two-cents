# The map is not the territory


==**The mind creates maps of reality** in order to understand it==, because the only way we can process the complexity of reality is through abstraction. But frequently, we don’t understand our maps or their limits. Even the best maps are imperfect, because they are reductions of what they represent. ==The map of reality **is not reality**.== If a map were to represent the territory with perfect fidelity, it would no longer be a reduction and thus would no longer be useful to us. A map can also be a snapshot of a point in time, representing something that no longer exists.

Korzybski notes:^[Korzybski, Alfred. “Part II: General on Structure.” In _Manhood of Humanity_. The International Non-Aristotelian Library Publishing Company, 1996. [http://esgs.free.fr/uk/art/sands.htm](http://esgs.free.fr/uk/art/sands.htm).]]

> Two important characteristics of maps should be noticed. ==A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, **it has a similar structure to the territory**, which accounts for its usefulness.== If the map could be ideally correct, it would include, in a reduced scale, the map of the map; the map of the map, of the map; and so on, endlessly, a fact first noticed by Royce.

> ==If we reflect upon our languages, we find that at best they must be considered only as maps.== A word is not the object it represents; and languages exhibit also this peculiar self-reflexiveness, that we can analyse languages by linguistic means. This self-reflexiveness of languages introduces serious complexities, which can only be solved by the theory of multiordinality.

Map limitations may include:^[Borrowed from: https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/]

(A.) **The map could be _incorrect_** without us realizing it_;_ 
(B.) **The map is, by necessity, a _reduction_ of the actual thing**, a process in which you lose certain important information; and 
(C.) **A map needs _interpretation_, a process that can cause major errors.** (The only way to truly solve the last would be an endless chain of maps-of-maps, which he called self-reflexiveness.)

Kahneman observes:

> ==The world in our heads is not a precise replica of reality==; our expectations about the frequency of events are distorted by the prevalence and emotional intensity of the messages to which we are exposed.
