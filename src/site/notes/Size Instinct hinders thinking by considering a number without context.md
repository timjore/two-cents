# Size Instinct hinders thinking by considering a number without context

from *[[References/Factfulness – Rosling, et al. (2018)\|Factfulness]]*:

> Factfulness is … recognizing ==when **a lonely number seems impressive (small or large)**, and remembering that you could get the opposite impression if it were compared with or divided by some other relevant number.==

To control the size instinct, get things in proportion.

- **Compare.** Big numbers always look big. Single numbers on their own are misleading and should make you suspicious. Always look for comparisons. Ideally, divide by something.

- **80/20.** Have you been given a long list? Look for the few largest items and deal with those first. They are quite likely more important than all the others put together.

- **Divide.** Amounts and rates can tell very different stories. Rates are more meaningful, especially when comparing between different-sized groups. In particular, look for rates per person when comparing between countries or regions.
