# Resilience Thinking understands thresholds and adaptive cycles

The essence of [[Resilience Thinking embraces the reality that things change\|Resilience Thinking]] is contained in two crucial concepts that underpin it: **Thresholds** and **Adaptive cycles**.

**Thresholds:** the point at which a system crosses over into another regime.

> Social-ecological systems can exist in more than one kind of stable state. ==If a system changes too much it crosses a threshold and begins behaving in a different way==, with different feedbacks between its component parts and a different structure. It is said to have undergone a “regime shift.”[^1]

- [[Staging/Resilience is the distance between the system and its nearest threshold\|Resilience is the distance between the system and its nearest threshold]]
- [[Proximity to a threshold decreases the shock required to cross it\|Proximity to a threshold decreases the shock required to cross it]]


**Adaptive cycles:** the pattern by which an ecosystem organizes itself and responds to a changing world.

> The other central theme to a resilience approach is how social-ecological systems change over time— systems dynamics. ==Social-ecological systems are always changing. A useful way to think about this is to conceive of the system moving through four phases: **rapid growth**, **conservation**, **release**, and **reorganization**==—usually, but not always, in that sequence. This is known as the adaptive cycle and these cycles operate over many different scales of time and space. The manner in which they are linked across scales is crucially important for the dynamics of the whole set.[^2]
