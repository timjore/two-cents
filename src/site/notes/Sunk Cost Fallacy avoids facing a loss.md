# Sunk Cost Fallacy avoids facing a loss

The Sunk Cost Fallacy (also known as *loss-aversion bias* or *Escalation of Commitment*) is the throwing of good money (or effort) after bad to avoid facing up to a loss. In more formal terms, it results when the ==disutility of giving up an object is greater than the utility associated with acquiring it.==[^1]


> ==**The decision to invest additional resources in a losing account, when better investments are available**, is known as the sunk-cost fallacy==, a costly mistake that is observed in decisions large and small.

> The sunk-cost fallacy keeps people for too long in poor jobs, unhappy marriages, and unpromising research projects. I have often observed young scientists struggling to salvage a doomed project when they would be better advised to drop it and start a new one. Fortunately, research suggests that at least in some contexts the fallacy can be overcome. The sunk-cost fallacy is identified and taught as a mistake in both economics and business courses, apparently to good effect: there is evidence that graduate students in these fields are more willing than others to walk away from a failing project.[^2]
