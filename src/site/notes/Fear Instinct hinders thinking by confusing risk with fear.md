# Fear Instinct hinders thinking by confusing risk with fear

from *[[References/Factfulness – Rosling, et al. (2018)\|Factfulness]]*:

> Factfulness is … recognizing when **==frightening things get our attention==, and remembering that ==these are not necessarily the most risky==.** Our natural fears of violence, captivity, and contamination make us systematically overestimate these risks.

To control the fear instinct, calculate the risks.

- **The scary world: fear vs. reality.** The world seems scarier than it is because what you hear about it has been selected—by your own attention filter or by the media—precisely because it is scary. (see: [[Availability Heuristic overestimates likelihood of events\|Availability Heuristic overestimates likelihood of events]])

- **==Risk = danger × exposure==.** The risk something poses to you depends not on how scared it makes you feel, but on a combination of two things. How dangerous is it? And how much are you exposed to it?

- **Get calm before you carry on.** When you are afraid, you see the world differently. Make as few decisions as possible until the panic has subsided.
