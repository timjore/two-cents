# Epistemic confidence pertains to truth

Epistemic confidence pertains to certainty about what is true and is different from social confidence (i.e., self assurance).

> Confidence is one of those words that we use to mean different things without even realizing it. One is ==epistemic confidence, or certainty—**how sure you are about what’s true**==. … Separately, there’s social confidence, or self-assurance: Are you at ease in social situations? Do you act like you deserve to be there, like you’re secure in yourself and your role in the group? Do you speak as if you’re worth listening to?[^1]
