# Leadership is maintaining full engagement from your group

Management, it has been said, is about “doing things right” whereas leadership is about “doing the right things.” While there is some truth in this distinction, a more helpful contrast is between management as optimizing for **efficiency** in performance of tasks, whereas leadership is about the producing and maintaining full **engagement** of the group in the right things.

> Management is the efficient accomplishment of tasks. ==Leadership is **producing and maintaining full engagement from our group in what matters.**==[^1]
