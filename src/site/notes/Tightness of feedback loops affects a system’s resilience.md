# Tightness of feedback loops affects a system’s resilience

The tightness of the feedback loops in a system contributes to the system’s resilience. When there are delays in the feedback, the system’s response time is slower, which reduces the systems’ ability to absorb the shock.

> Tightness of feedbacks refers to how quickly and strongly the consequences of a change in one part of the system are felt and responded to in other parts. Institutions and social networks play key roles in determining tightness of feedbacks. ==Centralized governance and globalization can weaken feedbacks. **As feedbacks lengthen, there is an increased chance of crossing a threshold** without detecting it in a timely fashion.==[^1]
