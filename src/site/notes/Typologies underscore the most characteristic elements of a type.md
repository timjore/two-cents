# Typologies underscore the most characteristic elements of a type

When depicting a typology, it is necessary to emphasize the most characteristic elements of a type. But in so doing, it does not imply that there are no nuances, counter-examples, or overlaps. Gonzalez elaborates:

> ==Any typology is of necessity schematic. It may be illuminating, as long as it is not taken too literally.== In this respect, a typology is like a caricature: When one sees a caricature of a person, one immediately recognizes the person by the exaggeration of prominent features, although no one could possibly have such features. Likewise, ==in drawing a typologyâ€¦ **one underscores those elements most characteristic of a particular type**. This helps clarify the issues and contrasts, as long as it is not understood as an actual description that makes all nuances superfluous.==[^1]
