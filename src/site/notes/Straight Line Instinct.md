# Straight Line Instinct

We tend to assume that linear progressions will continue far longer than they usually do. Most progressions do not continue in a straight line for long.

> Factfulness is … recognizing the assumption that a line will just continue straight, and remembering that **such lines are rare in reality**.

To control the straight line instinct, remember that curves come in different shapes.

- **Don’t assume straight lines.** Many trends do not follow straight lines but are S-bends, slides, humps, or doubling lines. No child ever kept up the rate of growth it achieved in its first six months, and no parents would expect it to.
