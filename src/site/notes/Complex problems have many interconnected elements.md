# Complex problems have many interconnected elements

A complex problem is one that is composed of many elements, with numerous connections between them.

> ==These connections may themselves be interdependent, creating **a system where one small local decision can lead to lots of repercussions and chain effects in other seemingly unrelated areas**.== These interrelationships make it very hard to split up the overall problem situation into smaller chunks that could be dealt with more easily (as one does in conventional problem-solving): one can never be sure that in doing so you are not severing key relations.[^1]
