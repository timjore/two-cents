# Finding the bright spots clones what is already working

In order to identify the vital behaviors that produce desired results, one must shift from a problem orientation to a solution orientation.

> To pursue bright spots is to ask the question “==**What’s working**, and **how can we do more of it?**==” Sounds simple, doesn’t it? Yet, in the real world, this obvious question is almost never asked. Instead, the question we ask is more problem focused: “**What’s broken, and how do we fix it?**”[^1]

This requires overcoming the tendency to focus on the negative—even though the semantic range of the lexicon of one’s own language may predispose it.
