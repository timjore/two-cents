# Innovators confront eight challenges

In *[[References/The Myths of Innovation – Berkun (2010)\|The Myths of Innovation]]*, Berkun identifies eight challenges to innovation:

1. **Finding an idea.** Ideas can come from anywhere: concentrated thinking, daydreaming, personal problems, observations of others, a coincidence, or the result of studying something in the world
2. **Developing a solution.** The idea is one thing; a working solution is another.
3. **Sponsorship and funding.** How will you fund the project, including #2?
4. **Reproduction.** It’s difficult to scale something: you might design a better mousetrap, but can you manufacture 50,000 cheaply enough to profit?
5. **Reaching potential customers.** An idea is not an innovation until it reaches people.
6. **Beating competitors.** While you’re working hard at #1–5, you won’t be alone.
7. **Timing.** As great as your idea is, will the culture be ready when it’s finished?
8. **Keeping the lights on.** While you’re dealing with all the innovation fun above, the bills will keep coming.[^1]
