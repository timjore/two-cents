# Prime directive of institutions is self-preservation

When an institution is formed around a stated purpose, a curious thing occurs. Regardless of the original purpose for the establishment of the institution, ==the primary purpose of the institution becomes: **preserve the institution**.==

Furthermore, [[Institutions become committed to preserving the problem they were formed to solve\|institutions that are formed to solve a problem inadvertently become committed to the preservation of that problem]]. If the problem disappears, society’s need for the institution does as well. The institution’s prime directive of preserving the institution supersedes the stated objective of the institution, thus ==**committing it to the preservation of the problem** in order to preserve its continued usefulness to society and justify its existence.==
