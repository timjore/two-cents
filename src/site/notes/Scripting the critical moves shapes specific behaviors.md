# Scripting the critical moves shapes specific behaviors

One of the most daunting challenges to overcome in achieving desired results is overcoming the [[Status quo bias favors the current state\|Status Quo Bias]]. Whenever there is ambiguity, the status quo will retain its strongest staying power.

> Ambiguity is the enemy. ==Any successful change requires a **translation of ambiguous goals into concrete behaviors**==. In short, to make a switch, you need to script the critical moves.[^1]

Changing individual behavior is difficult, because that is precisely where the friction is. 

> Change begins at the level of individual decisions and behaviors, but that’s a hard place to start because that’s where the friction is. Inertia and decision paralysis will conspire to keep people doing things the old way. … ==To spark movement in a new direction, you need to provide crystal-clear guidance.== That’s why scripting is important—==you’ve got to think about the **specific behavior that you’d want to see** in a tough moment…==[^2]

This requires thinking out in front of the scenarios that are likely to produce paralysis and status quo behavior, and script an alternate series of actions with crystal clarity that lead to a different set of behaviors and outcomes.
