# Symptomatic solutions exacerbate fundamental causes

The [[Addressing symptoms shifts the burden from addressing fundamental causes\|“shifting the burden”]] structure explains a wide range of behaviors were well-intended solutions are adopted because they are simple and easy, but they are actually merely symptomatic solutions. They may result in apparent improvement in the near-term (and adopting them is evidence of “doing something about the problem”), but easing a problem’s symptoms also diminishes the need to find a fundamental solution that addresses it decisively.

> Beware the symptomatic solution. ==Solutions that address only the symptoms of a problem, not fundamental causes, tend to have **short-term benefits at best**==. In the long term, the problem resurfaces and there is increased pressure for symptomatic response. Meanwhile, ==the **capability for fundamental solutions can atrophy**==. 

How can a “shifting the burden” structure be recognized?

> There are three clues to the presence of a shifting the burden structure. First, there’s ==a problem that gets **gradually worse** over the long term==—although every so often it seems to get better for a while. Second, the ==**overall health** of the system gradually worsens==. Third, there’s a ==growing feeling of **helplessness**==. People start out feeling euphoric—they’ve solved their problem!—but instead end up feeling as if they are victims.[^1]
