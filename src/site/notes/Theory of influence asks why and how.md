# Theory of influence asks why and how

Anyone who attempts to influence someone to act differently has a theory of influence, whether it is realized or not.

> …. everyone has a theory of influence. Even if you don’t think you do, you do! ==This theory shows up every time you answer two questions:==
> ==1. Why are they **doing that**?==
> ==2. How can I help them **do this** instead?==[^1]
