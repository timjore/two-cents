# Integrative, macroscopic thinking sees the forest and the trees

In general, a specialist knows a lot about a narrow scope of things in a given domain. In the same way, a superspecialist knows nearly everything that is knowable about an even narrower scope of things in a given domain. We could think of this as the ability to focus on and understand a tree.

In this analogy, integrative, macroscopic thinking is the ability to understand how the trees function as part of an ecosystem called a forest. It is the result of [[References/Range â€“ Epstein (2019)\|range]] and ==the ability to understand how the parts form (and may exceed the sum of) the whole==. It is ==this kind of thinking that leads to innovation==, as it can reach across unrelated disciplines in order to apply ideas and concepts from one to another.
