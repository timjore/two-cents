# Healthy teams thrive on new ideas

> ==Teams with healthy idea life cycles are easy to spot: **ideas flow between people easily and in large volumes**==. Conversations are vibrant with questions and suggestions; prototypes and demos happen regularly; and people commit to finding and fighting for good ideas. Often, this is fun—people are happy to learn from failures, debates, and bizarre ideas. ==Teams that innovate are great places for ideas to live==; like happy pets, they’re treated well, get lots of attention, and are shared among people who care deeply about them. …==The life of ideas is **the responsibility of whoever is in charge**==. He defines it by his responses and behavior, especially when he’s challenged by someone else’s ideas.[^1]
