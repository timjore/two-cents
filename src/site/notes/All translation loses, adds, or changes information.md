# All translation loses, adds, or changes information

The objective of good translation is to communicate all the meaning of the original without addition, subtraction, or distortion. Nonetheless, as the saying goes *Traduttore, Traditore* (“the translator is a traitor”).

> Eugene Nida, a prominent contributor to the literature on translation, writes: “==All types of translation involve (1) **loss** of information, (2) **addition** of information, and/or (3) **skewing** of information.==”[^1]
