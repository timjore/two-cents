# Creativity doesn’t look creative when you’re doing it

Creativity comes from reducing the pressure on the brain to produce, enabling the free association of thoughts and concepts to reconnect in innovative ways.

**Innovation comes from inefficiency.** 

One cannot innovate efficiently. High production environments are great for manufacturing, not for rethinking, innovating, creating.

> A simple afternoon walk around the neighborhood, for example, can reveal the path to profitability. In tough times, however, we’re praised for staying at our desks and burning the midnight oil. ==**How are you supposed to see the horizon with your nose pressed against the grindstone?** Thanks in large part to the factory mentality of modern workplace culture, organizations discourage the very behaviors that can save them.==[^1]
