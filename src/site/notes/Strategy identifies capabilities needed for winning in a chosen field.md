# Strategy identifies capabilities needed for winning in a chosen field

With the how-to-win decision made, the team needs to determine what capabilities need to be in place in order to achieve the plan.

> Two questions flow from and support the heart of strategy: (1) what capabilities must be in place to win, and (2) what management systems are required to support the strategic choices? The first of these questions, ==the capabilities choice, relates to the **range and quality of activities** that will enable a company to win where it chooses to play==. Capabilities are the map of activities and competencies that critically underpin specific where-to-play and how-to-win choices.[^1]
