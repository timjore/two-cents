# Frame creation seeks to understand the root factors of stakeholders

Once the “field” in which a problem exists has been identified, frame creation seeks to discover the root factors of those in the field, which suggest themes that connect the problem’s stakeholders.

> In theme analysis, ==we identify and seek to understand the deeper factors that underlie the needs, motivation, and experiences== of the “players” in this wider field. A theme analysis ends with ==an understanding of the “universals,” a selection of **themes that are relevant to the problem situation on the deeper level at which players in the field have much in common**==. Because these universals are hidden beneath the surface of our everyday (professional) lives, it can be quite difficult to make them explicit.[^1]
