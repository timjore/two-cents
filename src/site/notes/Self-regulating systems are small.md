# Self-regulating systems are small

Systems that do not exceed a certain size retain the ability to self-regulate:

> This means that ==smallness is not an accidental whim of creation. It fulfils a most profound purpose. It is the **basis of stability and duration, of a graceful harmonious existence that needs no master**.== For little bodies, countless in number and for ever moving, for ever rearrange themselves in the incalculable pattern of a mobile balance whose function in a dynamic universe is to create ==**orderly systems and organisms** without the necessity of interfering with the anarchic freedom of movement== granted to their component particles.[^1]

Once the limits are outgrown, a system begins to experience the problem of “unmanageable proportions”—the *problems* pertaining to the business of growing will increase faster than the growth of the *system* itself.

> As has already been indicated, it is not any particular economic system that seems at fault, but economic size. ==Whatever outgrows certain limits begins to suffer from the irrepressible problem of unmanageable proportions. When this happens to a community, its problems will not only increase faster than its growth; they will be of a new order, arising no longer from the business of living but from the business of growing.== Instead of growth serving life, life must now serve growth, perverting the very purpose of existence.[^2]
