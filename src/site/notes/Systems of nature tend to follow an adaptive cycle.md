# Systems of nature tend to follow an adaptive cycle

By studying ecosystems all around the world, Researchers who study ecosystems have observed that most systems of nature usually proceed through ”==recurring cycles consisting of four phases: **rapid growth**, **conservation**, **release**, and **reorganization**.== The manner in which the system behaves is different from one phase to the next with changes in the strength of the system’s internal connections, its flexibility, and its resilience. … This cycle is known as an ==**adaptive cycle** as it describes how an ecosystem organizes itself and how it responds to a changing world==. The notion of an adaptive cycle developed as a useful metaphor for describing change in ecological systems.[^1]

The adaptive cycle has two opposing modes. A **development loop** (or “fore” loop), and **a release and reorganization loop** (or “back” loop) (see figure above). 

> The **fore loop** (sometimes called the front loop or forward loop) is characterized by the ==accumulation of capital, by stability and conservation, a mode that is essential for system (and therefore human) well-being to increase==. The **back loop** is characterized by ==uncertainty, novelty, and experimentation.== The back loop is the time of ==greatest potential for the initiation of either destructive or creative change in the system==. It is the time when human actions— intentional and thoughtful, or spontaneous and reckless—can have the biggest impact.[^2]
