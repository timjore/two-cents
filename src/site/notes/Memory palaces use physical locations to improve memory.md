# Memory palaces use physical locations to improve memory

A memory palace is a mnemonic device that uses the memory of a physical location (e.g., the layout of a house) to organize and recall the things to be remembered. The human brain is not efficient at memorizing abstract things, but it is very good at remembering spatial layouts. Thus, the memory palace technique uses the brain’s natural ability for remembering places as leverage for remembering things.

> A memory palace is a more complex type of mnemonic device that is useful for organizing and holding larger volumes of material in memory. It’s based on the *method of loci*, which goes back to the ancient Greeks and involves ==associating mental images with a series of physical locations to help cue memories==.

> ==Humans remember pictures more easily than words.== (For example, the image of an elephant is easier to recall than the word “elephant.”) So it stands to reason that associating vivid mental images with verbal or abstract material makes that material easier to retrieve from memory.[^1]

According to legend, the memory palace originated in ancient Greece, as recounted in [[References/Moonwalking with Einstein – Foer (2011)\|Moonwalking with Einstein – Foer (2011)]]:

> There were no other survivors.
>
> Family members arriving at the scene of the fifth-century-B.C. banquet hall catastrophe pawed at the debris for signs of their loved ones—rings, sandals, anything that would allow them to identify their kin for proper burial.
> 
> Minutes earlier, the Greek poet Simonides of Ceos had stood to deliver an ode in celebration of Scopas, a Thessalian nobleman. As Simonides sat down, a messenger tapped him on the shoulder. Two young men on horseback were waiting outside, anxious to tell him something. He stood up again and walked out the door. At the very moment he crossed the threshold, the roof of the banquet hall collapsed in a thundering plume of marble shards and dust.
> 
> He stood now before a landscape of rubble and entombed bodies. The air, which had been filled with boisterous laughter moments before, was smoky and silent. Teams of rescuers set to work frantically digging through the collapsed building. The corpses they pulled out of the wreckage were mangled beyond recognition. No one could even say for sure who had been inside. One tragedy compounded another.
> 
> Then something remarkable happened that would change forever how people thought about their memories. Simonides sealed his senses to the chaos around him and reversed time in his mind. The piles of marble returned to pillars and the scattered frieze fragments reassembled in the air above. The stoneware scattered in the debris re-formed into bowls. The splinters of wood poking above the ruins once again became a table. Simonides caught a glimpse of each of the banquet guests at his seat, carrying on oblivious to the impending catastrophe. He saw Scopas laughing at the head of the table, a fellow poet sitting across from him sponging up the remnants of his meal with a piece of bread, a nobleman smirking. He turned to the window and saw the messengers approaching, as if with some important news.
> 
> Simonides opened his eyes. He took each of the hysterical relatives by the hand and, carefully stepping over the debris, guided them, one by one, to the spots in the rubble where their loved ones had been sitting.
> 
> At that moment, according to legend, the art of memory was born.[^2]
