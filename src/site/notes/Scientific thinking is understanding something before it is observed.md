# Scientific thinking is understanding something before it is observed

Through observation, calculation, and intuition, leading thinkers gain the ability to understand phenomena before they can actually observe them.

> ==The ability to **understand something before it’s observed** is at the heart of scientific thinking.== In antiquity, Anaximander understood that the sky continues beneath our feet long before ships had circumnavigated the Earth. At the beginning of the modern era, Copernicus understood that the Earth turns long before astronauts had seen it do so from the moon. In a similar way, Einstein understood that [[Time passes more slowly in some places than others\|time does not pass uniformly everywhere]] before the development of clocks accurate enough to measure the different speeds at which it passes.[^1]
