# Optimizing a system reduces its resilience

Attempts to achieve [[Optimization aims to hold a system in an optimal state\|system optimization]] are doomed to fail, because [[Systems cannot be held in an optimal state\|systems cannot be held in an optimal state]]. Furthermore, the optimization of a system is inversely correlated to its resilience.

> …==the more you optimize elements of a complex system== of humans and nature for some specific goal, ==the more you diminish that system’s resilience==. A drive for an efficient optimal state outcome has the effect of **making the total system more vulnerable to shocks and disturbances**.[^1]

The more variation and inefficiency, the more resilient the system is to a wider range of shocks and disturbances.
