# Forecasting calculates the future from known data

Forecasting is a managerial practice of ==calculating future supply and demand based on known data== (“how many widgets can we make and sell next year”). This is similar to (but is also significantly different from) [[Strategic forecasting guides decision-making and catalyzes innovation\|Strategic Forecasting]], which is a leadership function that includes known data as a factor, but integrates broader trends through “horizon scanning” and [[Scenario Planning envisions the future\|Scenario Planning]].
