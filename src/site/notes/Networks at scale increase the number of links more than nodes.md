# Networks at scale increase the number of links more than nodes

As a network grows, ==the number of links required to connect all the nodes grows disproportionately== to the number of nodes.

For example, this helps explain why a small team has much less complexity and overhead in communications and maintenance of relationships, but as the team grows larger, it becomes impossible to retain the same strength of connection with all the other members of the team.
