# Diverse systems are more resilient than uniform systems

A system that has multiple redundant pathways, connections, and options is more resilient to external shocks to the system than systems highly optimized for efficiency, as these inherently have fewer redundancies and less flexibility.

> ==**A diverse system with multiple pathways and redundancies is more stable and less vulnerable** to external shock than a uniform system with little diversity==. — Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.[^1]
