# Simple rules tame complexity

When faced with complex challenges, humans tend to rely on experts to create complex solutions. This is problematic, because **meeting complexity with complexity can create more confusion** than it resolves. ==A more effective means of addressing complex challenges is is to devise simple rules to shape behavior, because **simple rules tame complexity better than complicated solutions**.==[^1] 

> Simple rules work, it turns out, because they do three things very well. First, they **confer the ==flexibility== to pursue new opportunities while maintaining some consistency**. Second, they can **produce ==better decisions==**. …Finally, simple rules **allow the members of a community to ==synchronize their activities== with one another on the fly**. As a result, communities can do things that would be impossible for their individual members to achieve on their own.
> …
> Applying complicated solutions to complex problems is an understandable approach, but flawed. The parts of a complex system can interact with one another in many different ways, which quickly overwhelms our ability to envision all possible outcomes.
