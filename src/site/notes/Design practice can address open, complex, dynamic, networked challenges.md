# Design practice can address open, complex, dynamic, networked challenges

[[Challenges are now open, complex, dynamic, and networked\|Challenges are now open, complex, dynamic, and networked]] and require a fundamentally different way of addressing them. Dorst suggests five key design practices that constitute “==**lessons from design practice** that we must learn from if we want to deal with open, complex, dynamic, and networked problem situations.==” These five practices “are the building blocks for the frame creation model.”[^1]

1. [[Coevolution simultaneously develops the formulation of and solution to a problem\|Coevolution]] – iterative development of both the problem space and solution space.
2. [[Developing problem situations allows reframing\|Developing problem situations]] 
3. [[Creating frames improves cognition\|Creating frames]]
4. [[Exploring themes leads to solutions\|Exploring themes]]
5. [[Fostering a discourse shapes behavior\|Fostering a discourse]]
