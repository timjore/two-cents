# Mental models influence how we think and act

Mental models are the cognitive frameworks that we use to make sense of life. Blessed are those who are able to use many of them, for they shall suffer much less from reductionist, simplistic thinking.

> “Mental models” are deeply ingrained ==assumptions, generalizations, or even pictures or images that influence **how we understand the world and how we take action**==. Very often, we are not consciously aware of our mental models or the effects they have on our behavior.[^1]
