# Social proof is most influential under three conditions

Social proof has the highest influence when situations are ambiguous, with large numbers of actors who are similar to the actor.

> The first is uncertainty. ==When people are unsure, **when the situation is ambiguous**, they are more likely to attend to the actions of others== and to accept those actions as correct. In ambiguous situations, for instance, the decisions of bystanders to offer emergency aid are much more influenced by the actions of other bystanders than when the situation is a clear-cut emergency. A second condition under which social proof is most influential involves “the many”: ==people are more inclined to follow the lead of others **in proportion to the others’ number**==. When we see multiple others performing an action, we become willing to follow because the action appears to be more (1) correct/valid, (2) feasible, and (3) socially acceptable. The third optimizing condition for social-proof information is similarity. ==**People conform to the beliefs and actions of comparable others**, especially their peers==—a phenomenon we can call peer-suasion.[^1]
