# Principles and practices in the creation of mental models

==A map is a **visual representation of reality**==. The map, as they say, is [[The map is not the territory\|not the territory]]. A map is necessarily a simplification of a complex reality. It does not model the system dynamics of the various ecologies that exist in the territory, for example. It merely depicts the essential geographical elements of the topology — the spatial relationships and rules between connecting or adjacent features (e.g., adjacency, containment, and connectivity).

It is this ==**simplification** that makes a map useful==. It provides a means of reducing paralyzing complexity to the essential elements necessary for orientation and navigation. However, it therefore follows that a map is useful only to the extent that it’s reduction of complexity to simplicity **accurately represents the territory**.

Mental models are cognitive maps — tools that help orient the thinking in ways that simplify complexity and make it easier (possible, even), to navigate the cognitive territory. The following principles pertain to the art of ”strategic cartography” (the creation of mental models):

- A mental model should be ==**as simple as possible, but not simpler**==.[^1]
- ==**All essential elements** of the cognitive topography want to be accounted for== in the mental model (see the second part of the previous point).
- To the extent that a mental model is optimally aligned with the reality it maps, it exhibits ==a **cognitive ”harmonic resonance”** that can be observed when *others* use the model== to successfully navigate the cognitive territory. Lights come on, people “get it” in ways they had not before.
- The most ==effective mental models are both **illuminating** and **generative**== (forming building blocks of new mental models and strategic insights).
- ==**Never fall in love with your mental model**==, because it is still wrong in ways you do not yet have the ability to see. 
- Always remember: [[Every logical model of reality must be continuously refined\|Every logical model of reality must be continuously refined]].)
- Thus, mental models in their optimal form are indistinguishable from ==mental models in a merely highly effective form that are **in need of revision**==.
- ==[[Scouts frequently update their maps\|Scouts frequently update their maps]]==, whereas the soldier mindset devolves into defense of their cherished mental model, even in the face of clear evidence of its need for revision.
- Creation, testing, and revision of mental models happens best in a [[Liquid Networks foster innovation\|liquid network]] of practitioners, innovators, and others willing to hold their assumptions loosely and iterate toward maximum effectiveness.
