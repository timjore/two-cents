# Innovation requires an organizational culture that values it

In addition to having effective leadership and a financial structure that supports it, innovation—especially disruptive innovation—requires an organizational culture that embraces the perpetual pursuit of new ways to accomplish their mission.

> Every innovation is difficult. ==That difficulty is compounded immeasurably, however, when a project is embedded in an organization in which most people are **continually questioning why the project is being done at all**==. …Executives can give an enormous boost to a project’s probability of success, therefore, when they ensure that it is being ==executed in an environment in which everyone involved views the endeavor as crucial to the organization’s future growth and profitability==.[^1]
