# Assertive inquiry moves dialog beyond argumentation

Conversations on contentious topics tend to devolve into two (or more) sides arguing for their position. Assertive inquiry articulates opinions while exploring the thinking of others.

> People’s default mode of communication tends to be advocacy—==argumentation in favor or their own conclusions and theories==, statements about the truth of their own point of view. … The kind of dialogue we wanted to foster is called assertive inquiry. Built on the work of organizational learning theorist Chris Argyris at Harvard Business School, this approach ==blends the explicit **expression of your own thinking** (advocacy) with a **sincere exploration of the thinking of others** (inquiry).== In other words, it means clearly articulating your own ideas and sharing the data and reasoning behind them, while genuinely inquiring into the thoughts and reasoning of your peers.[^1]

In order for assertive inquiry to work, people need to think differently about the part they play in conversation.

> To do this effectively, ==individuals need to **embrace a particular stance about their role in a discussion**.== … a reasonably straightforward but traditionally underused one: “I have a view worth hearing, but I may be missing something.” It sounds simple, but ==this stance has a dramatic effect on group behavior if everyone in the room holds it==. Individuals try to explain their own thinking—because they do have a view worth hearing. So, they advocate as clearly as possible for their own perspective. But because they remain open to the possibility that they may be missing something, two very important things happen. One, ==they advocate their view as a possibility, not as the single right answer==. Two, they listen carefully and ask questions about alternative views. Why? Because, if they might be missing something, ==the best way to explore that possibility is to understand not what others see, but what they do not.==[^2]
