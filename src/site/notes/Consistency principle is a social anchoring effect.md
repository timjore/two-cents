# Consistency principle is a social anchoring effect

*“There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking.” —Sir Joshua Reynolds*

Once someone expresses a position or opinion, they tend toward remaining consistent with what they have expressed.

> It is our desire to be (and to appear) consistent with what we have already said or done. *==Once we make a choice or take a stand, we encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to **think and behave consistently with that commitment**.==* Moreover, those pressures will cause us to respond in ways that justify our decision.[^1]

The drive to remain consistent is a powerful driving force, “often causing us to act in ways contrary to our own best interest.”[^2] Why is that?

> To understand why consistency is so powerful a motive, we should recognize that ==in most circumstances, **it is valued and adaptive**==. Inconsistency is commonly thought to be an undesirable personality trait. The person whose beliefs, words, and deeds don’t match is seen as confused, two-faced, even mentally ill. On the other side, ==a high degree of consistency is normally associated with **personal and intellectual strength**. It is the heart of logic, rationality, stability, and honesty.==

In short, consistency is a mental shortcut that obviates the need to think.

> First, like most other forms of automatic responding, consistency offers a shortcut through the complexities of modern life. Once we have made up our minds about an issue, ==stubborn consistency allows us an appealing luxury: **we don’t have to think hard about the issue anymore**==. We don’t have to sift through the blizzard of information we encounter every day to identify relevant facts; we don’t have to expend the mental energy to weigh the pros and cons; we don’t have to make any further tough decisions.[^3]
