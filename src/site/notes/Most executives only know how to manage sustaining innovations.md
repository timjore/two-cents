Most organizations are not structured (and cultured) for disruptive innovation, which results in the vast majority of innovations being sustaining in nature. Consequently, most organizational leaders only know how to manage sustaining innovations.

> Because the vast majority of innovations are sustaining in character, ==**most executives have learned to manage innovation in a sustaining context**, where analysis and planning were feasible.==[^1]

This sets them up for difficulty, because [[Knowledge of managing sustaining innovations is incommensurable with disruptive innovations\|Knowledge of managing sustaining innovations is incommensurable with disruptive innovations]].
