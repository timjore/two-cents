# Systems thinking is defined by laws

Systems thinking is the cornerstone of the learning organization and can be summarized in the following laws:[^1]

1. **Today’s problems come from yesterday’s “solutions.”**
2. **The harder you push, the harder the system pushes back.** (see: [[Compensating feedback offsets interventions\|Compensating feedback offsets interventions]])
3. **Behavior grows better before it grows worse.** (see: [[Low-leverage interventions are alluring because they work in the short term\|Low-leverage interventions are alluring because they work in the short term]])
4. **The easy way out usually leads back in.** (see: [[Non-systemic thinking relies on familiar (but ineffective) solutions\|Non-systemic thinking relies on familiar (but ineffective) solutions]])
5. **The cure can be worse than the disease.** (see: [[Non-systemic solutions are addictive\|Non-systemic solutions are addictive]])
6. **Faster is slower.** (see: [[Systems grow best at their optimal rate, not faster\|Systems grow best at their optimal rate, not faster]])
7. **[[Cause and effect are not closely related in time and space\|Cause and effect are not closely related in time and space]].**
8. **Small changes can produce big results—but the areas of highest leverage are often the least obvious.** (see: [[Leverage in the right location is more effective than the amount used\|Leverage in the right location is more effective than the amount used]])
9. **You can have your cake and eat it too—but not at once.**
10. **Dividing an elephant in half does not produce two small elephants.** (see: [[Systems are integrative, cohesive, and indivisible\|Systems are integrative, cohesive, and indivisible]])
11. **There is no blame.**
