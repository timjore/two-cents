# Communicating ideas requires overcoming the curse of knowledge

In *Made to Stick*, the authors argue that the essential challenge of good communication is overcoming the curse of knowledge.

> **Once we know something, ==we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it.==** Our knowledge has “cursed” us. And it becomes difficult for us to share our knowledge with others, because ==we can’t readily re-create our listeners’ state of mind==.[^1]

The stickiest ideas, they suggest, overcome the curse of knowledge by following six principles for SUCCESs: Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories:

1. **Simple** – [[Simple communication expresses the core of an idea\|Simple communication expresses the core of an idea]].
2. **Unexpected** – [[Unexpected communication violates expectations\|Unexpected communication violates expectations]].
3. **Concrete** – [[Concrete communication explains in terms of human actions and senses\|Concrete communication explains in terms of human actions and senses]].
4. **Credible** – [[Credible communication carries its own credentials\|Credible communication carries its own credentials]].
5. **Emotional** – [[Emotional communication makes people feel something\|Emotional communication makes people feel something]].
6. **Stories** – [[Story-based communication elicits effective responses\|Story-based communication elicits effective responses]].

The goal is to tell a **Simple Unexpected Concrete Credentialed Emotional Story**.
