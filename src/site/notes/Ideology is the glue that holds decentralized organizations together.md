# Ideology is the glue that holds decentralized organizations together

In order for a decentralized organization to retain its cohesion and purpose, it requires a shared vision and the parameters (norms) by which it operates. In this regard, ideology is “the glue that holds decentralized organizations together.”[^1]

> **The capacity of this \[decentralized] design for effective performance over time may depend on the existence of ==shared principles, interests, and goals==**— perhaps an overarching doctrine or ideology—which spans all nodes and to which the members subscribe in a deep way. **Such a set of principles, shaped through mutual consultation and consensus-building, can enable members to be ==“all of one mind” even though they are dispersed and devoted to different tasks.== It can provide a central ideational and operational coherence that allows for ==tactical decentralization==.** It can ==**set boundaries and provide guidelines for decisions and actions** so that the members do not have to resort to a hierarchy because “they know what they have to do.==[^2]
