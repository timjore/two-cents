# Locking down of a problem leads to frozen thinking

A common problem-solving tendency is to isolate the problem so that it can be deconstructed and analyzed. For complex (or wicked) problems, this tends to lead to entrained thinking:

>  …==the **locking down of a problem situation**, leads to a deeply engrained inability of organizations to step beyond the boundaries of their earlier ways of thinking==. Creativity consultants then provide workshops to help people “think outside the box”—which may help a little, but organizations often do not realize what a real change in their own practice will mean, and do not realize that ==the boxes they are trying to escape from are completely self-made==.[^1]
