# Lexicons constrain the range of possible belief

Paradigms are defined and shaped by their lexicon. The acquisition of the lexicon of a paradigm prevents *belief* in another paradigm, it prevents even the ability to *think* about it.

> Its point is not that the acquisition of a particular \[lexicon] bars belief in certain propositions ... Rather, ==the acquisition of a particular \[lexicon] **bars even the formulation, conceptual or verbal, of certain beliefs** held by users of another \[lexicon].== Different or differently structured \[lexica] give access to different, though largely overlapping, ranges of possible belief.[^1]

Thus, it stands to reason that inter-paradigmatic communication requires some degree of [[Inter-paradigm communication requires paradigmatic bilingualism\|paradigmatic bilingualism]] which itself is only possible through the suspension or “pausing” of one lexicon in order to gain cognitive access to another lexicon and the paradigm that it makes accessible.

> Users of one \[lexicon] ==must be **able to suspend or bracket it** in order to **gain access to some of the propositions that are candidates for belief** to the users of the other \[lexicon].==[^2]
