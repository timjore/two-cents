# Centralized systems are efficient, not disruptively innovative

The efficient and standardized a system is, the less it is able to revolutionize itself, or the domain in which it exists.

> There is an undeniable efficiency that attends a monopoly’s doing what it has been perfected to do, whether that be to turn out a certain kind of film or provide a universal phone service. ==What such well-oiled machines do not do so well, however, is initiate the sort of **creative destruction that revolutionizes industries and ultimately multiplies productivity and value**.== And where information is the ultimate commodity, the multiplier effect is incalculably great.[^1]

Thus, as centralized systems optimize for efficiency and standardization, they do so [[Efficiency is purchased by a loss in flexibility\|at the cost of resilience and strategic agility]].
