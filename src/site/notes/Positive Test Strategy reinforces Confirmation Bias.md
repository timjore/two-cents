# Positive Test Strategy reinforces Confirmation Bias

A positive test strategy refers to ==the deliberate **seeking out and recalling information that confirms** what we already know or believe to be true==. This can result in a confirmation bias, where we only pay attention to information that supports our pre-existing beliefs while ignoring or dismissing information that contradicts them.[^1] While a positive test strategy can be helpful in some situations, such as reinforcing previously learned material, it can also limit our ability to consider new information and challenge our assumptions. As [[References/Thinking, Fast and Slow – Kahneman (2013)\|Kahneman]] notes: 

> The operations of associative memory contribute to a general confirmation bias…  Contrary to the rules of philosophers of science, who advise testing hypotheses by trying to refute them, **people (and scientists, quite often) seek data that are likely to be compatible with the beliefs they currently hold**.

In order to overcome this bias, one must consciously identify the operative assumption(s) and deliberately search for evidence that *disproves* the assumptions.[^2]
