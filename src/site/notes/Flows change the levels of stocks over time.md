# Flows change the levels of stocks over time

Flows (inflows or outflows) change the levels of a stock over time. The aggregate history of all flows within a system results in the current stock.

> ==Stocks change over time through the actions of a flow==. Flows are filling and draining, births and deaths, purchases and sales, growth and decay, deposits and withdrawals, successes and failures. ==A stock, then, is the **present memory of the history of changing flows** within the system==.[^1]

Stocks are more apparent than flows, especially outflows.

> The human mind seems to ==focus more easily on stocks than on flows==. On top of that, when we do focus on flows, we tend to focus on inflows more easily than on outflows. Therefore, we sometimes miss seeing that we can fill a bathtub not only by increasing the inflow rate, but also by decreasing the outflow rate.[^2]
