# New paradigms tend to emerge all at once

When someone is deeply immersed in the [[New paradigms are preceded by crisis\|crisis of a paradigm]] that is [[Paradigms change when they can no longer address anomalies\|unable to account for certain anomalies]], the crisis itself provides the context for the sudden emergence of a new paradigm.

> … crisis simultaneously loosens the stereotypes and provides the incremental data necessary for a fundamental paradigm shift. ==Sometimes the shape of the new paradigm is foreshadowed== in the structure that extraordinary research has given to the anomaly. … More often no such structure is consciously seen in advance. Instead, ==the new paradigm, or a sufficient hint to permit later articulation, **emerges all at once**, sometimes in the middle of the night, **in the mind of a man deeply immersed in crisis**.==[^1]
