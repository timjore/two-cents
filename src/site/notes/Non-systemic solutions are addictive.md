# Non-systemic solutions are addictive

[[Low-leverage interventions are alluring because they work in the short term\|Short term solutions to complex problems]] are low cost and quick-acting, which can have the effect of a narcotic—it creates dependence (and may be subject to the law of diminishing returns).

> The long-term, most insidious ==consequence of applying non-systemic solutions is **increased need for more and more of the solution**==. … The phenomenon of short-term improvements leading to long-term dependency is so common, it has its own name among systems thinkers—it’s called ==“shifting the burden to the intervenor.”==[^1]
