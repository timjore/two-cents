# Solutions to complex problems depends on a clear frame

A good frame is like a picture that is in focus and well-lit, visually communicating with consistency and clarity. 

> It is important to make the frames as sharp and precise as possible. ==A frame is **only effective when it evokes a very clear picture in the mind**, and when it does so for all the major stakeholders.== Often, honing a frame to convey such a sharp picture can be achieved by combining themes or by combining several frame ideas. It often pays in frame creation to overdo this, and oversharpen the frames:[^1]
