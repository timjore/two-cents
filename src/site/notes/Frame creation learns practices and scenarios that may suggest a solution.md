# Frame creation learns practices and scenarios that may suggest a solution

Once we understand how the problem came into existence, as well as the core paradox that prevents the problem’s owner from resolving it, the frame creation process moves on to “an exploration of ==the practices of the inner circle of key stakeholders who have been involved in the problem situation== before, or those who are clearly going to be ==necessary participants in any possible solution==. By carefully examining them, we seek out significant influences on their behavior and what strategies they currently employ. In this way, ==we gain a sense of practices and scenarios that could become part of the solution==.[^1]

The [[Frame creation resolves complex problems in nine steps\|nine steps]] of frame creation:
1. [[Frame creation begins with investigation\|Archaeology]] – Investigate who has already tried what to solve the problem.
2. [[Frame creation requires understanding the core paradox\|Paradox]] – Understand the core paradox of the problem.
3. **Context** – Learn practices and scenarios that may suggest a solution.
4. [[Frame creation considers all stakeholders of the problem and solution\|Field]] – Consider all stakeholders of the problem and solution.
5. [[Frame creation seeks to understand the root factors of stakeholders\|Themes]] – Seek to understand the root factors of stakeholders.
6. [[Frame creation identifies common themes as the basis for frames\|Frames]] – Identify common themes as the basis for frames.
7. [[Frame creation thinks forward to identify solutions\|Futures]] – “Think forward” to identify solutions.
8. [[Frame creation develops a plan for transformation\|Transformation]] – Develop a plan for transformation.
9. [[Frame creation integrates solutions into the stakeholder context\|Integration]] – Integrate solutions into the stakeholder context.
