# An idea can fail in any number of ways

For an idea to succeed, it must avoid all possible shortcomings. Any number of shortcomings could bring about its failure.

> Leo Tolstoy began his novel Anna Karenina with the famous opening line “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Out of this notion Jared Diamond popularized the “Anna Karenina principle,” which holds that ==any one of several shortcomings can guarantee the failure of an idea, while **success depends on avoiding all possible shortcomings**==. Scaling is, in the end, a weakest-link problem: the endeavor is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain.

> ==There are multiple ways an idea can fail at scale==, and to achieve high voltage, you must check each of the Five Vital Signs: false positives, misjudging the representativeness of an initial population or situation, spillovers, and prohibitive costs. Any one of these alone can sink your ship.[^1]
