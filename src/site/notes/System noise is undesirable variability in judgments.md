# System noise is undesirable variability in judgments

System noise is “==**undesirable variability in the judgments of the same case** by multiple individuals==. We have identified its two major components, which can be separated when the same individuals evaluate multiple cases: 

- *Level noise* is variability in the average level of judgments by different judges. 
- *Pattern noise* is variability in judges’ responses to particular cases.”[^1]
