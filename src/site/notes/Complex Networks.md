# Complex Networks

A complex network is a type of network (graph) that is composed of many interconnected nodes that are characterized by their non-trivial topological features, such as highly connected nodes (called “hubs”), clusters of nodes, and multiple paths between nodes.

> **A network is considered scale-free \[i.e., complex\] if its degree distribution (the probability that a node selected uniformly at random has a certain number of links), follows a particular mathematical function called a [[Power Law distributions\|Power Law]].** The Power Law implies that the degree distribution of these networks has no characteristic scale. In contrast, networks with a single well-defined scale are somewhat similar to a lattice in that every node has (roughly) the same degree.
