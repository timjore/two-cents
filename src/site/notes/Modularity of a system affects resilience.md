# Modularity of a system affects resilience

A system with a monolithic design is composed of component pieces that are tightly integrated together into a single structure. Such highly connected systems (that is, they have many links between all components) means ”shocks tend to travel rapidly through the whole system.”[^1] 

Modularity “relates to the manner in which the components that make up a system are linked.”[^2] When internal links are strong but connections are loose, the system is more resilient.

> Systems with subgroups of components that are strongly linked internally, but only loosely connected to each other, have a modular structure. A degree of ==**modularity in the system allows individual modules to keep functioning when loosely linked modules fail**, and the system as a whole has a chance to self-organize and therefore a greater capacity to absorb shocks.==[^3]
