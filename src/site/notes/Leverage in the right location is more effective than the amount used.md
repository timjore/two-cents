# Leverage in the right location is more effective than the amount used

Big problems, we tend to assume, require big solutions. This can result in either wasting a lot of effort or the “killing the mosquito with a howitzer” phenomenon—even if you kill the mosquito, you may create massive collateral (and otherwise avoidable) damage. It is more effective to understand the system and bring just the right amount of leverage to the right place to fix the system.

> … systems thinking also shows that small, well-focused actions can sometimes produce significant, enduring improvements, if they’re in the right place. Systems thinkers refer to this principle as “leverage.” … Tackling a difficult problem is often a matter of seeing where the high leverage lies, a change which—with a minimum of effort— would lead to lasting, significant improvement.[^1]
