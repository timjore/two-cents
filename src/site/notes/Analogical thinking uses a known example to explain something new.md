# Analogical thinking uses a known example to explain something new

Analogical thinking is ==a cognitive process in which one **uses a known example or analogy to understand or explain something new** or unfamiliar.== It involves making comparisons between two or more things and identifying similarities and differences. Analogical thinking is ==a way to **make connections between seemingly unrelated concepts** and to **generate new insights and ideas**.==

Analogical thinking can be in problem-solving, decision-making, and creativity. It allows people to leverage their existing knowledge and understanding to make sense of new information. *For example, using an analogy of a journey to understand a complex process, or using an example of a machine to understand a biological system.*

Epstein notes that it can be employed to help solve wicked problems:

> Deep ==**analogical thinking** is the practice of recognizing conceptual similarities in multiple domains== or scenarios that may seem to have little in common on the surface. ==It is a **powerful tool for solving [[Staging/Wicked Problems\|Wicked Problems]]**==
