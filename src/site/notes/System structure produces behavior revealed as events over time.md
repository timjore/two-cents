# System structure produces behavior revealed as events over time

“==System structure== is the source of ==system behavior==. System behavior reveals itself as a ==series of events over time==.”[^1]

> ==Systems fool us by presenting themselves==—or we fool ourselves by seeing the world—==as a series of events==. … We are less likely to be surprised if we can see how events accumulate into dynamic patterns of behavior. … ==The behavior of a system is its performance over time==—its growth, stagnation, decline, oscillation, randomness, or evolution. If the news did a better job of putting events into historical context, we would have better behavior-level understanding, which is deeper than event-level understanding. ==When a systems thinker encounters a problem, the first thing he or she does is **look for data, time graphs, the history of the system**.== That’s because ==**long-term behavior** provides clues to the **underlying system structure**. And structure is the key to understanding not just what is happening, but **why**.==[^1]
