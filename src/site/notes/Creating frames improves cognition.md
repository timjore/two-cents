# Creating frames improves cognition

Once a [[Developing problem situations allows reframing\|problem space has been developed]], designers create frames that illuminate the problem space and solution space.

> \[A] frame is ==an **organizational principle** or a coherent set of statements that are **useful to think with**==. Although frames can sometimes be paraphrased by a simple and elegant statement … they are actually quite complex and subtle thought tools. Proposing a frame includes the use of certain concepts, which are assigned significance and meaning. These concepts are not neutral at all: they will steer explorations and the perceptions in the process of creation.… ==Frames should therefore be **actionable**—that is, they should be **capable of leading to realistic solutions**.== For a frame to really come “alive,” it also has to be inspiring and captivating. It should immediately ==draw forth mental images in the key people involved, and trigger solution ideas== through a quick-fire stream of consciousness.[^1]

Useful frames are carefully designed to achieve the following:[^2]

- Create “an image that **spans and integrates a broad range of issues** under consideration and might draw in even more issues from outside the original problem arena.” 
- Be “coherent, and provide a stable (noncontradictory) **basis for further thought**.” 
- Be “robust, in the sense that the images they conjure up in the minds of the participants are sufficiently similar to **provide a “common ground”** for the discussion of the problem and possible solutions.” 
- Are “inspiring and original —perhaps not completely new to the world, but at least **new to the problem setting**.” 
- Are “very **thought-provoking and lively**, engaging people’s imagination so their thoughts readily move along in the proposed direction.”
