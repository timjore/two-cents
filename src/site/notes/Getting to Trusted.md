# Getting to Trusted

Factors that affect the degree to which content (e.g., a Bible translation, a Greek New Testament, etc.) increases in “trustedness.“ In contrast with the trustworthiness of a text or the license under which it is made available, the trust that others place in a text cannot be controlled, only predisposed. Along these lines, note that all the external factors are directly predisposable to the degree that funding is brought to bear.

**INTRINSIC:**
- **transparency** – degree of clarity and consistency of production process *(e.g., adherence to translation brief, consistency and transparency in text-critical method, etc.)*
- **acceptability** – degree to which content meets audience needs while avoiding niche or ideological peripheries *(i.e., remaining within the window of potential “mainstream” solutions.)*  
- **collaborativity** – degree to which multiple people are involved, not merely the work of a singular person

**EXTRINSIC:**
- **popularity** (\$\$\$) – degree of usage, market share, presence
- **endorsement** (\$\$) – affirmation and support of text by reputable influencers
- **production** (\$) – degree of editorial control leading to consistent and accurate forms of language *(e.g., correct spelling, no missing words, etc.)*
- **presentation** (\$) – visual appeal and “quality” of production *(e.g., the world's best Bible translation will be less trusted if published on plain paper using Comic Sans or Papyrus than in any other font as a real book)*
- **branding** (\$\$) – presence of a unique, recognizable identifier *(e.g., a trademark, publisher imprint, etc.)*

**TIME:**
- **persistence** – duration of consistent availability of content *(i.e., frequent exposure increases familiarity which tends to increase trust)*
