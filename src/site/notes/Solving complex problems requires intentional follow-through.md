# Solving complex problems requires intentional follow-through

Once the frame creation workshop has concluded, it is imperative that the frame creation process itself continue.

> Experience has shown that it takes a couple of months to rework the session more thoroughly. One should check any assumptions that may have entered the discussion, dig into literature to achieve depth and thoughtfulness in the themes, sharpen the frames, make a much more exhaustive exploration of possible solutions and map these against the original problem, etc. ==The result of this follow-through is a report for the problem owner and key stakeholders, which is much more extensive and penetrating than the knowledge, insights, and ideas that are generated at the frame creation workshop session.== After this report has been handed over, a lengthy phase of consultation often follows.[^1]
