# Rallying the herd makes behavior contagious

Achieving change is not merely an individual phenomenon—it requires paying attention to and shaping the social signals of the group.

> ==In ambiguous situations, we all **look to others for cues about how to behave**==. …It’s clear that we imitate the behaviors of others, whether consciously or not. We are especially keen to see what they’re doing when the situation is unfamiliar or ambiguous. And change situations are, by definition, unfamiliar! So if you want to change things, ==you have to **pay close attention to social signals**, because they can either guarantee a change effort or doom it==.[^1]

Ultimately, “rallying the herd” is about changing the culture of the group, as this is often the linchpin of organizational change.

> You want certain people to act differently, but they are resistant to the change. So you rally the support of others who in turn could influence those you hope to sway. In essence, ==it’s an attempt to **change the culture**, and culture often is the linchpin of successful organizational change==.[^2]
