# Accordion Principle says systems oscillate between centralization and decentralization

Over time, industries tend to oscillate from greater centralization to greater decentralization. Neither centralization or decentralization is inherently better or worse for an industry—the different systemic configurations have different advantages and disadvantages.

> We call this radical swing “the accordion principle.” Over time, ==industries swing from being decentralized to centralized to decentralized and back again.== In response to overcentralized industries or institutions, people rebel and create open starfish systems.[^1]
