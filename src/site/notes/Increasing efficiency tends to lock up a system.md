# Increasing efficiency tends to lock up a system

After experiencing rapid growth, a complex adaptive system tends to shift into the conservation phase. This happens commensurate to the [[Efficiency is purchased by a loss in flexibility\|drive to increase efficiency]], which tends to decrease the effectiveness of a system. This situation is characterized by:[^1]

- ==Increases in efficiency being achieved through the **removal of apparent redundancies**== (one-size-fits-all solutions are increasingly the order of the day); 
- ==Subsidies being introduced are almost always to **help people not to change** (rather than to change)==; 
- ==**More “sunk costs” effects**== in which we put more of our effort into continuing with existing investments rather than exploring new ones (the Concorde effect); 
- ==**Increased command and control** (less and less flexibility)==; 
- ==A **preoccupation with process**== (more and more rules, more time and effort devoted to sticking to procedures); 
- ==**Novelty being suppressed**, with less support for experimentation==; and 
- ==**Rising transaction costs**== in getting things done.
