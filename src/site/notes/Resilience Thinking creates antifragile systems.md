# Resilience Thinking creates antifragile systems

When a new system (e.g., an organization) is instituted to solve a problem, it often maximizes innovation by implementing a divergent exploration of various solutions. As the system matures, ==the initial value of exploration and innovation tends to be replaced by convergence toward a single (or very few) means== of solving the problem, in order to maximize efficency. But this creates a problem: [[Efficiency is purchased by a loss in flexibility\|Efficiency is purchased by a loss in flexibility]]. ==**Resilience thinking** attempts to design [[Antifragile Systems become stronger with shocks\|Antifragile systems]] that are able to withstand (and even improve from) shocks.==

> “Resilience thinking” is a burgeoning field that attempts to deal in new ways with the new challenges of complexity. In a resilience paradigm, managers accept the reality that they will inevitably confront unpredicted threats; rather than erecting strong, specialized defenses, ==they create systems that aim to roll with the punches, or even benefit from them==. Resilient systems are those that can encounter unforeseen threats and, when necessary, put themselves back together again.[^1]

In *Resilience Thinking*, Walker and Salt note that the drive for efficiency and optimal outcomes directly results in a more vulnerable system:

> ==**the more you optimize** elements of a complex system of humans and nature for some specific goal, **the more you diminish that system’s resilience**.== A drive for efficient optimal state outcome has the effect of **making the total system more vulnerable to shocks and disturbances**.[^2]
