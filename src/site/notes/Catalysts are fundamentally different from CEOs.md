# Catalysts are fundamentally different from CEOs

It is easy to [[Decentralized systems are easily mistaken for centralized systems\|confuse decentralized organizations with centralized ones]], but they are different in pronounced ways, especially with regard to leadership. 

> But as we spent more time with the catalysts, powerful patterns emerged that weren’t just new and interesting but also surprising. ==We were dealing with an **entirely different creature from the CEO**. … .==[^1]

The role of a CEO is common and easily understood. “A CEO is The Boss. He’s in charge, and he occupies the top of the hierarchy.” By contrast, a Catalyst:[^3]

- interacts with people as a peer
- comes across as your friend
- empowers people and gets out of the way
- is inspirational and collaborative; “they talk about ideology and urge people to work together to make the ideology a reality.”
- avoids attention and tend to work behind the scenes
- tends to be mission-oriented, regardless of a profit motive

The tools of a Catalyst include:[^2]

- **Genuine Interest in Others** – “To a catalyst, ==people are like walking novels==.”
- **Loose Connections** – “Most of us have interesting personal conversations with a select group of our closest friends. But a catalyst is able to have these kinds of interactions with thousands—in fact, ==they thrive on meeting new people== every day.”
- **Mapping** – “Catalysts think of who they know, who those people know, how they all relate to one another, and how they fit into a huge mental map. Catalysts don’t just know more people; they also ==spend time thinking about how each person fits within their network==.”
- **Desire to Help** – 
- **Passion** – “The catalyst ==provides the drumbeat for a decentralized organization==. Because it can’t draw upon command-and-control to motivate participants, it needs a strong and ongoing ideology to keep them going.”
- **Meet People Where They Are** – “When people feel heard, when they feel understood and supported, they are more likely to change. A catalyst doesn’t prescribe a solution, nor does he hit you over the head with one. Instead, he assumes a peer relationship and listens intently. You don’t follow a catalyst because you have to—==you follow a catalyst because he understands you.==”
- **Emotional Intelligence** – “All the catalysts we’ve met are intellectually brilliant, but ==they tend to lead with emotions==.”
- **Trust** – “It’s not enough to meet people where they are and to form emotional bonds with them; a catalyst must also trust the network. With a flattened hierarchy, you never know what people are going to do. You can’t control the outcomes, and you can’t really reproach a member if he becomes errant. ==All you can control is whether people have personal relationships with each other based on trust==.”
- **Inspiration** – “A true catalyst isn’t just a matchmaker but also ==an inspiration to others to work toward a goal that often doesn’t involve personal gain==.”
- **Tolerance for Ambiguity** – “One of the most common answers we got when we talked to catalysts was ‘I don’t know.’ … Catalysts aren’t absent-minded. They often don’t know because there aren’t concrete answers to these questions. Being a catalyst requires a high tolerance for ambiguity. That’s because ==a decentralized organization is so fluid that someone who needs order and structure would quickly go mad==.”
- **Hands-Off Approach** – “Perhaps the most difficult and counterintuitive element of being a catalyst is getting out of the way. … ==giving members a high level of ownership over the organization==.”
- **Receding** – “After catalysts map a network, make connections, build trust, and inspire people to act, what do they do? They leave. If they were to stay around, ==catalysts might block the decentralized organization’s growth==.”
