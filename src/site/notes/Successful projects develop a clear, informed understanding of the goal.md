# Successful projects develop a clear, informed understanding of the goal

People often begin a project assuming they need a solution, but without acutally understanding the goal. Understanding the goal depends first on [[Design thinking seeks to discover and solve the actual problem\|understanding the actual problem]].

> Projects are often started by jumping straight to a solution, even a specific technology. That’s the wrong place to begin. You want to start by asking questions and considering alternatives. At the outset, always assume that there is more to learn. ==Start with the most basic question of all: **Why?**== … At the beginning of a project, ==we need to disrupt the psychology-driven dash to a premature conclusion by **disentangling means and ends**== and thinking carefully about what exactly we want to accomplish. … ==Developing **a clear, informed understanding of what the goal is and why**==—and never losing sight of it from beginning to end—==is the foundation of a successful project.==[^1]
