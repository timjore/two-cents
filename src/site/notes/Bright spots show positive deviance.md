# Bright spots show positive deviance

Change is most readily accomplished when someone in the group is already modeling the desired behavior. They are deviating in a positive way from the status quo.

> Positive deviance occurs ==when an individual or group should have the problem you’re trying to solve but doesn’t. In other words, **they deviate from the norm in a positive direction**.== … [^1]

By identifying and pointing to the “bright spots,” others may be encouraged to follow and start to shift the trajectory of the group.
