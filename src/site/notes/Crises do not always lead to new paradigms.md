# Crises do not always lead to new paradigms

A crisis is a [[New paradigms are preceded by crisis\|necessary prerequisite]] for a paradigm to change, but the presence of a crisis does not always result in a changed paradigm: ① The current paradigm may discover a resolution to the crisis; ② The problem may persist, resisting the formation of a new paradigm to account for it; or ③ The crisis may precipitate the emergence of a new paradigm.

> And all crises close in one of three ways. Sometimes ==normal science ultimately proves able to handle the crisis-provoking problem== despite the despair of those who have seen it as the end of an existing paradigm. On other occasions ==the problem resists even apparently radical new approaches==. Then scientists may conclude that no solution will be forthcoming in the present state of their field. The problem is labelled and set aside for a future generation with more developed tools. Or, finally, the case that will most concern us here, ==a crisis may end with the emergence of a new candidate for paradigm== and with the ensuing battle over its acceptance.[^1]
