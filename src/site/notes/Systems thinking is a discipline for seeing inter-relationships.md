# Systems thinking is a discipline for seeing inter-relationships

Systems thinking is “a discipline for seeing wholes… a framework for seeing inter-relationships rather than things, for seeing patterns of change rather than static ‘snapshots.’”[^1]

> It is a set of general principles … It is also a set of specific tools and techniques… Systems thinking is ==a discipline for seeing the “structures” that underlie complex situations, and for **discerning high from low leverage change**==. That is, by seeing wholes we learn how to foster health. To do so, systems thinking offers a language that begins by restructuring how we think.[^2]
