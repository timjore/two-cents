# Availability Heuristic overestimates likelihood of events

The availability heuristic is ==the tendency to overestimate the likelihood of events with greater “availability” in memory,== particularly if they are vivid and emotionally charged. The classic example is how travel by airplane drops shortly after a fatal crash which is vividly portrayed in new outlets. Air travel is still statistically one of the safest modes of transportation, but the availability of a shocking memory of a recent tragedy make it seem more likely to occur than it is.

> The availability heuristic, like other heuristics of judgment, ==**substitutes one question for another**: you wish to estimate the size of a category or the frequency of an event, but you report an impression of the ease with which instances come to mind==.[^1]  

Some sub-examples of the availability heuristic include the [[Anchoring Bias pulls an unknown value toward a known anchor\|Anchoring Bias pulls an unknown value toward a known anchor]] and [[Sunk Cost Fallacy\|Sunk Cost Fallacy]].
