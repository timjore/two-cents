# Behavioral change fails when it requires absolute recantation

Change is hard, but if it requires a person to categorically reject everything they believed, it may be impossible.

> Breaking through these attitudes \[that are resistant to change] is difficult because “you’re asking someone to give up the values and beliefs at the core of how they see themselves” … ==You’ll never succeed at getting someone to change their behavior “if, as a prerequisite, you force them to say: Everything I’ve believed until now is wrong…”==[^1]
