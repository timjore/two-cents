# Systems are the interconnection between structure and ensuing patterns of behavior

A system is “an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something.”[^1] The patterns of behavior that ensue from the system are the result of the system’s structure.

> Once we see the ==**relationship between structure and behavior**, we can begin to understand how systems work==, what makes them produce poor results, and how to shift them into better behavior patterns. … So, what is a system? ==A system is a set of things==—people, cells, molecules, or whatever—==interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behavior over time==.[^2]
