# Deliberate practice is focused, at the edge, with feedback

Deliberate practice is composed of three elements:

1.   [[Practice one or two specific skills\|Practice one or two specific skills]] 
2.   [[Practice skills at the edge of ability\|Practice skills at the edge of ability]]
3.   [[Practice with immediate feedback and coaching\|Practice with immediate feedback and coaching]]

> … ==when these elements are present, **skill acquisition accelerates**==. And when they are absent (which they are in most “learning” settings), very little growth occurs.[^1]
