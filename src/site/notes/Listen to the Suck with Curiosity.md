# Listen to the Suck with Curiosity

Listening to the Suck with Curiosity (LSC) is **”overcoming the urge to defend and dismiss when attacked and instead investigating failure with an open mind.”**[^1] Effective leaders do not block out criticism or attacks and instead seek to investigate failure (“the suck”) so as to understand why it happened and how to resolve it. In *Loonshots*, Bahcall observes:

> If you’ve poured your soul into a project, ==the temptation to dismiss bad outcomes is high.== What you crave is reassurance that you’re on the right track. So you ignore or attack your challengers and turn for reassurance to your friends, mentors, mother.
>...
> LSC means not only listening for the Suck and acknowledging receipt but also ==**probing beneath the surface, with genuine curiosity, why something isn’t working**, why people are not buying.== It’s hard to hear that no one likes your baby. It’s even harder to keep asking why.
> ...
> LSC, for me, is a signal. When someone challenges the project you’ve invested years in, ==do you defend with anger or **investigate with genuine curiosity**?== I find it’s when I question the least that I need to worry the most.[^2]
