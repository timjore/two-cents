# Learning organizations implement five component technologies

>… five new component technologies are gradually converging to innovate learning organizations. Though developed separately, each will, I believe, prove critical to the others’ success, just as occurs with any ensemble. ==Each provides a vital dimension in building organizations that can truly “learn,” that can **continually enhance their capacity to realize their highest aspirations**==…[^1]

The five “technologies” are:

- [[Systems Thinking perceives the relationships and structure of complex systems\|Systems Thinking]]
- [[Personal mastery is life in service of your highest aspirations\|Personal Mastery]]
- [[Mental models influence how we think and act\|Mental Models]]
- [[Building shared vision results in intrinsic motivation\|Building Shared Vision]]
- [[Team learning is thinking together\|Team Learning]]

Systems Thinking, according to Senge, is the fifth discipline as it is “the discipline that integrates the disciplines, fusing them into a coherent body of theory and practice.”[^2]

> But ==systems thinking also needs the disciplines of building shared vision, mental models, team learning, and personal mastery to realize its potential==. **Building shared vision** fosters a commitment to the long term. **Mental models** focus on the openness needed to unearth shortcomings in our present ways of seeing the world. **Team learning** develops the skills of groups of people to look for the larger picture beyond individual perspectives. And **personal mastery** fosters the personal motivation to continually learn how our actions affect our world. Without personal mastery, people are so steeped in the reactive mindset (“someone/something else is creating my problems”) that they are deeply threatened by the systems perspective.[^3]
