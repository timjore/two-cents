# In decentralized social systems leadership is by influence

Unless a stratified hierarchy is created and enforced, leadership in social systems is by relational influence, not coercion. Leaders lead by example, encouragement, sacrifice, and through strength of relational ties.

>==In a decentralized organization, there’s **no clear leader, no hierarchy, and no headquarters**. If and when a leader does emerge, that person has little power over others. The best that person can do **to influence people is to lead by example**.== Nevins calls this ==an open system, because everyone is entitled to make his or her own decisions.== This doesn’t mean that a decentralized system is the same as anarchy. There are rules and norms, but these aren’t enforced by any one person. Rather, the power is distributed among all the people and across geographic regions.[^1]
