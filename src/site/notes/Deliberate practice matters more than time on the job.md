# Deliberate practice matters more than time on the job

Psychologist Anders Ericsson suggests that exceptional performance is the result of **deliberate practice** (“*perfect* practice makes perfect”).

> Ericsson found that no matter the field of expertise, when it comes to elite status, ==there is no correlation between time in the profession and performance levels==. A 20-year-veteran brain surgeon is not likely to be any more skilled than a 5-year rookie by virtue of time on the job. ==Any difference between the two has nothing to do with experience and **everything to do with deliberate practice**==. … time is not the critical variable for mastery. ==The critical factor is **using time wisely**==. It’s the skill of practice that makes perfect.[^1]
