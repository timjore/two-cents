# Metaphors form the basis of our ability to think

In *[[References/Metaphors We Live By â€“  Lakoff and Johnson (2008)\|Metaphors We Live By]]*, Lakoff and Johnson argue that metaphors are the means by which we define our reality and thus shape how we act.

> ==In all aspects of life, not just in politics or in love, **we define our reality in terms of metaphors and then proceed to act on the basis of the metaphors**.== We draw inferences, set goals, make commitments, and execute plans, all on the basis of how we in part structure our experience, consciously and unconsciously, by means of metaphor.[^1]

However, metaphors both illuminate and also obscure our ability to think.

> ==**The very systematicity that allows us to comprehend one aspect of a concept in terms of another** (e.g., comprehending an aspect of arguing in terms of battle) **will necessarily hide other aspects of the concept**.==[^2]

Thus, it is important to be aware of the limitations of the metaphors we use and introduce new metaphors to improve our ability to think.
