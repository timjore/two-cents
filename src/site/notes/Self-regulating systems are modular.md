# Self-regulating systems are modular

[[Modularity of a system affects resilience\|Modularity]] is an important aspect of a self-regulating system:

> As a result, ==a good balance in a living, breathing, and changing arrangement—be it a system of stars, states, or men—must be a mobile balance==, a balance whose **self-regulatory feature** is derived from the **independent existence** of a great number of **small component parts held together** not in tight unity but **elastic harmony**.[^1]

A system that becomes too large will be decreasingly capable of self-regulation and must be modularized in order to become self-regulating:

> In other words, if smallness represents nature’s mysterious principle of health, and bigness its principle of disease, division—==the transformation of a controlled stable into a self-regulatory mobile balance through the splitting of its parts—must of necessity represent its principle of cure.==[^2]
