# Time passes more slowly in some places than others

Time is not constant, but passes more slowly in some places than others. At lower altitudes, there is less time. A person in the mountains has more time than a person at sea level. A clock on the floor runs more slowly than one on a table.

> Let’s begin with a simple fact: time passes faster in the mountains than it does at sea level… The difference is small but can be measured with precision timepieces that can be bought today on the internet for a few thousand dollars. With practice, anyone can witness the slowing down of time. With the timepieces of specialized laboratories, this slowing down of time can be detected between levels just a few centimeters apart: ==a clock placed on the floor runs a little more slowly than one on a table.==
> 
> It is not just the clocks that slow down: lower down, all processes are slower. Two friends separate, with one of them living in the plains and the other going to live in the mountains. They meet up again years later: the one who has stayed down has lived less, aged less, the mechanism of his cuckoo clock has oscillated fewer times. He has had less time to do things, his plants have grown less, his thoughts have had less time to unfold. . . . ==Lower down, there is simply less time than at altitude==.
