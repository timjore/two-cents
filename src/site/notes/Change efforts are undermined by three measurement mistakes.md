# Change efforts are undermined by three measurement mistakes

In order to ascertain progress (or not) toward a desired outcome, it is necessary to measure the things that are motivating at a frequency that sustains attention.

> Change efforts are often undermined by three common measurement mistakes. Either ==leaders take no measures==, they ==measure something too distant to be motivating==, or their measures are ==too infrequent to sustain attention==.
