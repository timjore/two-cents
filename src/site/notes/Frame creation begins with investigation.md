# Frame creation begins with investigation

The first step of the frame creation process is to “investigate in depth the apparent problem, as well as earlier attempts to solve it. This analysis is crucial, as we need to ==delve deeply into the world of the problem owner in order to **understand the past history of the problem**==. We investigate not only what happened but also what could have happened, what would have been different if they had chosen another path… ==This first step of “archaeology” also provides insight into **the role the problem owner has had in creating the problem situation**, and it gives a first impression of the dynamics of the organization over time.==[^1]

The [[Frame creation resolves complex problems in nine steps\|nine steps]] of frame creation:
1. **Archaeology** – Investigate who has already tried what to solve the problem.
2. [[Frame creation requires understanding the core paradox\|Paradox]] – Understand the core paradox of the problem.
3. [[Frame creation learns practices and scenarios that may suggest a solution\|Context]] – Learn practices and scenarios that may suggest a solution.
4. [[Frame creation considers all stakeholders of the problem and solution\|Field]] – Consider all stakeholders of the problem and solution.
5. [[Frame creation seeks to understand the root factors of stakeholders\|Themes]] – Seek to understand the root factors of stakeholders.
6. [[Frame creation identifies common themes as the basis for frames\|Frames]] – Identify common themes as the basis for frames.
7. [[Frame creation thinks forward to identify solutions\|Futures]] – “Think forward” to identify solutions.
8. [[Frame creation develops a plan for transformation\|Transformation]] – Develop a plan for transformation.
9. [[Frame creation integrates solutions into the stakeholder context\|Integration]] – Integrate solutions into the stakeholder context.
