# Networked problems influence each other

Problems that are complex are therefore dynamic and, because of their interconnectedness, they change in ways that affect one another—often in unpredictable ways.

> The networked nature of today’s problem situations means that ==they potentially influence each other constantly== … What other people are doing in seemingly unrelated fields might cause an effect that severely influences your problem field and options for action.[^1]
