# Frame creation identifies common themes as the basis for frames

Themes that are identified in the analysis of the root factors of a problem and its stakeholders form the basis for frames.

> ==Throughout the in-depth analysis of the broader field, common themes will emerge that can be different from those underlying the original paradox. Themes that are **shared among many of the players in the field** are particularly interesting, as they **could be the basis for frames** that are attractive to a network of partners.== While these inklings can be a strong springboard, the ideation of a new frame is largely a creative leap. Again, experience with a varied repertoire of frames is clearly an advantage—having a team from diverse backgrounds can be inspiring for this step.[^1]

The [[Frame creation resolves complex problems in nine steps\|nine steps]] of frame creation:
1. [[Frame creation begins with investigation\|Archaeology]] – Investigate who has already tried what to solve the problem.
2. [[Frame creation requires understanding the core paradox\|Paradox]] – Understand the core paradox of the problem.
3. [[Frame creation learns practices and scenarios that may suggest a solution\|Context]] – Learn practices and scenarios that may suggest a solution.
4. [[Frame creation considers all stakeholders of the problem and solution\|Field]] – Consider all stakeholders of the problem and solution.
5. [[Frame creation seeks to understand the root factors of stakeholders\|Themes]] – Seek to understand the root factors of stakeholders.
6. **Frames** – Identify common themes as the basis for frames.
7. [[Frame creation thinks forward to identify solutions\|Futures]] – “Think forward” to identify solutions.
8. [[Frame creation develops a plan for transformation\|Transformation]] – Develop a plan for transformation.
9. [[Frame creation integrates solutions into the stakeholder context\|Integration]] – Integrate solutions into the stakeholder context.
