# The “Dunning-Kruger Effect” causes people to overestimate their abilities and not realize they have done so

Incompetence not only causes people to overestimate their competence, but prevents them from being able to recognize their lack of it.

In a 1999 study, Kruger and Dunning observed:

> The authors suggest that this overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but ==their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it==.[^1]

In a subsequent study, they elaborated on their earlier work:

> Successful negotiation of everyday life would seem to require people to possess insight about deficiencies in their intellectual and social skills. However, people tend to be blissfully unaware of their incompetence. This lack of awareness arises because poor performers are doubly cursed: ==Their lack of skill deprives them not only of the ability to produce correct responses, but also of the expertise necessary to surmise that they are not producing them.== People base their perceptions of performance, in part, on their preconceived notions about their skills. Because these notions often do not correlate with objective performance, they can lead people to make judgments about their performance that have little to do with actual accomplishment.[^2]
