# Wicked problems can only be addressed by systems thinking

Solving a wicked problem requires a systemic approach that takes into account the interrelatedness of the problem, and involve a diverse set of stakeholders in the problem solving process. Additionally, it often requires a long-term perspective, as well as the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Wicked problems can not be solved once and for all, but rather need to be managed over time.

The term "wicked problem" was first coined by Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber in the 1970s to describe the challenges of urban planning. They argued that traditional problem-solving methods were not effective in addressing these types of problems because they involve multiple perspectives, are constantly evolving, and are difficult to fully understand. Examples of wicked problems include issues such as poverty, climate change, and healthcare.
