# When attacked, decentralized systems tend to become moreso

When centralized systems are threatened, the default response is to “circle the wagons” and become more centralized. Decentralized systems, by contrast, tend to further decentralize, diluting the force of the attack.

> This is the first major principle of decentralization: ==when attacked, a decentralized organization tends to become **even more open and decentralized**==.[^1]

Principles of decentralization:
1. When attacked, decentralized systems tend to become moreso
2. [[Decentralized systems are easily mistaken for centralized systems\|Decentralized systems are easily mistaken for centralized systems]]
3. [[Intelligence is spread throughout decentralized systems\|Intelligence is spread throughout decentralized systems]]
