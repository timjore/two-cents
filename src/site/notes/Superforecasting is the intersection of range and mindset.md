# Superforecasting is the intersection of range and mindset


Superforecasting is the point of intersection between the concepts in (at least) these books:
- [[References/Range – Epstein (2019)\|Range – Epstein (2019)]] – Innovation and insight is often found in the space between many domains/skills.
- [[References/Persuadable – Pittampalli (2016)\|Persuadable – Pittampalli (2016)]] – The pursuit of truth, even at the expense of changing one’s mind.
- [[References/Mindset – Dweck (2006)\|Mindset – Dweck (2006)]] – Mistakes are learning vs. Mistakes mean I’m stupid.
- [[References/Thinking, Fast and Slow – Kahneman (2013)\|Thinking, Fast and Slow – Kahneman (2013)]] – System 1 thinking (intuitive, immediate) is often inferior to System 2 thinking (deliberate, careful).
- [[References/The Scout Mindset – Galef (2021)\|The Scout Mindset – Galef (2021)]] – Scouts pursue the truth vs. Soldiers defend their opinions.
