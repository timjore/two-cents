# Healthy systems are self-regulating

Unhealthy systems require a proactive regulation. Healthy systems are self-regulating.

> ==The chief symptom of a bad balance is thus not that it is either mobile or stable, but that it **needs a conscious regulating authority**.== This happens whenever it is out of place, as when the mobile balance of change is imposed on things that are rigid or a stable balance of rigidity on a dynamic system of change.[^1]
