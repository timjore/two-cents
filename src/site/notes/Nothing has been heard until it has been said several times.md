# Nothing has been heard until it has been said several times

The hearing and understanding of a message—particular a disruptive or paradigm-shifting one—usually only happens when the message has been communicated so many times that the communicator begins to wonder if it will ever be understood.

> Experience had taught me that ==nothing was heard until it had been **said several times**==. Only when I heard my own words echoed or paraphrased back to me by subordinates as essential “truths” did I know they had been fully received.[^1]
