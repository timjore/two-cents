# Power Law distributions

from [[References/Linked – Barabási, Frangos (2002)\|Linked – Barabási, Frangos (2002)]]:

> a histogram following a power law is **==a continuously decreasing curve==, implying that many small events coexist with a few large events.**
> …
> **Power laws formulate in mathematical terms the notion that ==a few large events carry most of the action==**. 
> …
> But **power laws are at the heart of some of the most stunning conceptual advances in the second half of the twentieth century**, emerging in fields like chaos, fractals, and phase transitions. Spotting them in networks signaled unsuspected links to other natural phenomena and placed networks at the forefront of our understanding of complex systems in general.
