# Power Law distributions

A power law distribution is a type of probability distribution that follows a pattern where **a small number of items** (such as events or entities) have **a disproportionately large number of occurrences**, while many items have very few occurrences. This kind of distribution is also known as a “scale-free“ distribution because it does not have a characteristic scale, and it is often found in [[Complex systems exhibit emergent behavior\|Complex systems exhibit emergent behavior]] such as the internet, social networks, and the distribution of wealth.

> a histogram following a power law is **==a continuously decreasing curve==, implying that many small events coexist with a few large events.**

> If the heights of an imaginary planet’s inhabitants followed a power law distribution, **most creatures would be really short. But nobody would be surprised to see occasionally a hundred-feet-tall monster walking down the street.** In fact, among six billion inhabitants there would be at least one over 8,000 feet tall.

> But **power laws are at the heart of some of the most stunning conceptual advances in the second half of the twentieth century**, emerging in fields like chaos, fractals, and phase transitions. Spotting them in networks signaled unsuspected links to other natural phenomena and **placed networks at the forefront of our understanding of [[Complex systems exhibit emergent behavior\|Complex systems exhibit emergent behavior]]** in general.
