# Organizations entrenched in what they do need to return to why they do it

In the late 1800s, the railroads were the largest companies in the country, reshaping America with their success. But over time, they lost sight of their core purpose. Instead of focusing on WHY they existed, they fixated on WHAT they did—they saw themselves strictly as railroad companies. Their limited perspective shaped their decisions, leading them to invest solely in tracks, crossties, and engines. Then, in the early 20th century, airplanes emerged, and those once-dominant railroad companies eventually faded away. *What if they had viewed themselves as part of the mass transportation industry instead?* Their approach might have been different. They might have recognized new opportunities and adapted.

> They have been **doing it the same way for so long** that their ability to compete against a new technology or see a new perspective becomes a daunting task. …
> In all cases \[e.g., music industry, newspapers, publishing, television, etc.\], ==**going back to the original purpose**, cause or belief will help these industries adapt==. Instead of asking, “WHAT should we do to compete?” the questions must be asked, ==“WHY did we start doing WHAT we’re doing in the first place, and WHAT can we do to **bring our cause to life** considering all the technologies and market opportunities available today?”==[^1]
