# Reframing shifts perspective to see things in a new way

When [[Complex problems require new thinking\|resolving complex challenges]], it can be helpful to adopt a designer’s mindset and consider the entire problem situation from a new perspective. By putting it in a different frame, new opportunities for understanding the relationships pertaining to the problem and potential solution emerge.

> In ==questioning the established patterns of relationships in a problem situation==, **design abduction** creates both ==a new way of looking at the problem situation and a new way of acting within it==. This comprehensive new approach to the problem situation is called a “frame” within design literature… Expressed in terms of the concepts in our logical formula, ==a **frame** is the proposal through which, by applying a particular pattern of relationships, we can create a desired outcome==.[^1]

Reframing is “a method of shifting semantic perspective in order to see things in a new way. The new frame ‘re-embeds"‘ a product, system, or service in a new (and not necessarily logical) context, allowing the designer to explore associations and hidden links to and from the center of focus.”[^2]

The process of reframing a complex challenge from a designer’s perspective involves the following steps:[^3]

1. **Identify the initial frame** – Understand the traditional (default) framing of the problem.
2. **Create blank reframing indices**. The design opportunity will be reframed from the point of view of *new entities*, *new contexts*, and *new embodiments* (or new manifestations of the core artifact). (Three charts can be used to structure the reframing exercises.)
3. **Reframe** – The designer will begin to develop (through structured or casual brainstorming) new items for the left column of each chart.
4. **Extrapolate likely user goals** – As the charts begin to become populated with new frames, the designer will begin to fill in the Primary User Goal for all items in all charts. They will paint a picture of a credible story, judging responses and adding criticism as appropriate.
5. **Extrapolate design implications** – The reframed design context will have produced new constraints or implications, or will have highlighted existing constraints and implications that may have been otherwise hidden or overlooked.
