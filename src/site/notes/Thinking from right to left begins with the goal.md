# Thinking from right to left begins with the goal

In order to achieve desired outcomes, it is important to begin with a clear understanding of the desired outcome and then work backward from it to implement a plan that achieves it. Flyvberg refers to this as “thinking from right to left” but notes that the same notion is present in many domains.

> “[[Backcasting works backward from a desired outcome\|Backcasting]]” is used in urban and environmental planning. … “Theory of change” is a similar process often used by government agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that seek social change, such as boosting literacy rates, improving sanitation, or better protecting human rights. Again, it starts by defining the goal and only then considers courses of action that could produce that outcome.[^1]

He goes on to note that this is difficult to do, precisely because it is backward from how we live life.

> ==Thinking from right to left is **demanding because it’s not natural**.== What’s natural is [[WYSIATI\|WYSIATI]]—What You See Is All There Is—and focusing exclusively on what is in front of you. And when you are obsessed with a cool idea or you are deep into designing the project or buried in a thousand and one details, the box on the right is nowhere to be seen. That’s when trouble starts.[^2]

In his classic book, [[References/The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People – Covey (2013)\|The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]], Covey notes:

> … the most fundamental application of “begin with the end in mind” is to begin today with the image, picture, or paradigm of the end of your life as your frame of reference or the criterion by which everything else is examined. … It is possible to be busy—very busy—without being very effective. ==“Begin with the end in mind” is based on the principle that **all things are created twice**. There’s a **mental** or first creation, and a **physical** or second creation, to all things.==[^3]
