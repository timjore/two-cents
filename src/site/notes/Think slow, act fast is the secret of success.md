# Think slow, act fast is the secret of success

In the realm of project management, there is an inverse relationship between speed of thinking (i.e., planning) and acting. 

- **“Think fast, act slow”** – When thinking and planning is hasty, the actual work of delivering the desired outcome tends to be beset by unexpected slowdowns and budget overruns.
- **Think slow, act fast** – When time is invested up front to fully understand the [[Design thinking seeks to discover and solve the actual problem\|actual problem]] as well as the [[Successful projects develop a clear, informed understanding of the goal\|goal]] and [[Double diamond implements design thinking\|design a solution]] that achieves the goal and solves the actual problem, the likelihood of achieving the desired outcome on time and under budget are much higher.

Thus, Flyvberg and Gardner argue:

> ==**Think slow, act fast**: That’s the secret of success==. … But “Think slow, act fast” is not how big projects are typically done. “Think fast, act slow” is. The track record of big projects unequivocally shows that.[^1]
