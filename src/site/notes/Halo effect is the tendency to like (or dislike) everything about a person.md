# Halo effect is the tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person

The halo effect is a cognitive bias where ==**one’s overall impression of a person influences their perception** of their individual traits or things associated with them==. If you like an actor/actress, you are more likely to appreciate their recommendation of the product they (have been hired to pretend to) like. If you like the president’s polices, you are more likely to also like his looks and tone of voice. The converse is also true: dislike of a person tends to negatively affect the perception of things associated with them.
