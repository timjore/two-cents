# Visionaries only succeed together with implementers

A visionary leader can only succeed to the extent that they are part of a team that includes more practically minded people working together to accomplish the vision. Having only a “why” makes you a philosopher. Having a “why” with a team that can turn that into “how” and “what” is essential for success.

> WHY-types are the visionaries, the ones with the overactive imaginations. They tend to be optimists who believe that all the things they imagine can actually be accomplished. HOW-types live more in the here and now. They are the realists and have a clearer sense of all things practical. ==WHY-types are **focused on the things most people can’t see**, like the future. HOW-types are **focused on things most people can see** and tend to be better at building structures and processes and getting things done.== One is not better than the other, they are just different ways people naturally see and experience the world.[^1]
