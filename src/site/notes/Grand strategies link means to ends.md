# Grand strategies link means to ends

A Grand Strategy:
- is a **long-term plan** (or doctrine, or course of action) that links the means (including resources and policies) of achieving an objective with its ends
- Accurately **assesses the complex global environment**
- Is **realistic about goals**
- Is **efficient in execution**
- Is **comprehensive**

> ==Successful grand strategies—the long-term doctrines that link means to ends thus leverage a whole country’s resources, public and private. They accurately **assess the complex global** environment, are **realistic about goals**, and are **efficient in execution**. They must also be **comprehensive**.==
