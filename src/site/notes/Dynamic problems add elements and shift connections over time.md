# Dynamic problems add elements and shift connections over time

Complex problems, by virtue of their numerous elements and the many connections between them, is almost never in stasis.

> ==A dynamic problem situation changes over time, with the **addition of new elements and the shifting of connections**== (e.g., through the shifting of priorities). These can be slow changes, driven by ponderous processes like cultural change, or lightning-quick movements driven by technological development, for instance.[^1]
