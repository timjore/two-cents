# Flexibility, simplicity and adaptability are simple rules of movements

The [[Simple rules tame complexity\|simple rules]] that shape effective behavior in movemental (complex) contexts are:
- **flexibility** – applicable in a wide range of variable configurations
- **simplicity** – easily understandable and reproducible by others
- **adaptability** – modifiable in response to changing environments
