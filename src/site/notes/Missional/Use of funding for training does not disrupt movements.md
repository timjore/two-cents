# Use of funding for training does not disrupt movements

Well-intended but misguided use of funds to advance discipleship movements can severely hinder the expansion of the church. Using funding for training increases the capacity of the network without curtailing its ability to expand.

> …we must consider how money can be used wisely to support a movement. ==In a word, training. **Invest in training**. Training leaders at every level in the Word of God puts the Gospel first in their hearts and lives.==[^1]
