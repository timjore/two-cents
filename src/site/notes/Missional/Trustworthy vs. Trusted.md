# Trustworthy vs. Trusted

The trustworthiness of a Bible translation is not necessarily correlated to the lingual church’s perception (and subsequent trust) of the translation.

The vertical axis represents the objective reality of a given translation as “trustworthy” or “not trustworthy.” The horizontal axis represents the lingual church’s perception of that translation as “trusted” or “not trusted.”[^1]
