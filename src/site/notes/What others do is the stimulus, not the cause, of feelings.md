# What others do is the stimulus, not the cause, of feelings

> … ==what others say and do **may be the stimulus, but never the cause, of our feelings**.== We see that ==our feelings result from **how we choose to receive what others say and do**, as well as from our **particular needs and expectations** in that moment==. With this third component, we are led to accept responsibility for what we do to generate our own feelings.[^1]
