# Paradigms change when they can no longer address anomalies

A **paradigm** refers to the framework of theories, methods, standards, and assumptions that represent and define a domain or industry. ==Paradigms tend to resist change, and so anomalies—problems the current paradigm cannot solve—are often ignored, and sometimes overlooked entirely.== When sufficient anomalies accumulate, pioneering thinkers begin the process of constructing a new paradigm that addresses the anomalies. This involves nothing less than architecting an entirely new worldview.

> ==Discovery commences with the **awareness of anomaly**==, i.e., with the ==recognition that nature has somehow violated the paradigm-induced expectations that govern normal science==. It then continues with a more or less extended exploration of the area of anomaly. And it closes only when the paradigm theory has been adjusted so that the anomalous has become the expected. ==Assimilating a new sort of fact demands a more than additive adjustment of theory==, and until that adjustment is completed—until the scientist has learned to see nature in a different way—the new fact is not quite a scientific fact at all.[^1]

Paradigms, therefore, necessarily account for all phenomena except anomalies that refuse to be assimilated.

> Only when these attempts at articulation fail do scientists encounter the third type of phenomena, the ==recognized anomalies whose characteristic feature is their stubborn refusal to be assimilated to existing paradigms==. This type alone gives rise to new theories. ==**Paradigms provide all phenomena except anomalies with a theory-determined place** in the scientist’s field of vision==.[^2]
