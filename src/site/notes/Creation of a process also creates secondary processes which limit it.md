# Creation of a process also creates secondary processes which limit it

A reinforcing (or amplifying) process of growth or improvement inevitably runs up against a balancing (or stabilizing) process which limits the growth, causing the rate of improvement to slow down or come to a standstill.

> A reinforcing (amplifying) process is set in motion to produce a desired result. ==It creates a spiral of success but **also creates inadvertent secondary effects** (manifested in a balancing process) **which eventually slow down the success**.==[^1]

The immediate tendency is to push harder on the amplifying process, but this only [[Compensating feedback offsets interventions\|causes the stabilizing process to increase]] as well. The key is to address the stabilizing process so as to decrease or remove the limiting factor.

> But there is another way to deal with limits to growth situations. In each of them, leverage lies in the balancing loop—not the reinforcing loop. ==To change the behavior of the system, you must **identify and change the limiting factor**.==[^2]

Good leaders recognize that “there will always be more limiting processes. When one source of limitation is removed or made weaker, growth returns until a new source of limitation is encountered. ==The skillful leader is **always focused on the next set of limitations** and working to understand their nature and how they can be addressed.=="[^3]
