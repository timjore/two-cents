# People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it

[[Staging/Processing/Slot 3/Influence can only be manipulative or inspirational\|Influence can only be manipulative or inspirational]]. When people lead with what they do (e.g., the product a company sells, the charitable work that an organization does, etc.), they inevitably employ a manipulative approach to influence. An alternative is to start with “why” they do what they do, rather than “what” they do.

> There are a few ==leaders who choose to **inspire rather than manipulate** in order to motivate people==. Whether individuals or organizations, every single one of these inspiring leaders thinks, acts and communicates exactly the same way. And it’s the complete opposite of the rest of us. Consciously or not, how ==they do it is by following a naturally occurring pattern that I call The Golden Circle==. … \[It\] is an alternative perspective to existing assumptions about why some leaders and organizations have achieved such a disproportionate degree of influence.

**WHAT:** Every company and organization in the world knows WHAT they do, regardless of size or industry. Everyone can clearly describe the products or services a company offers or their specific role within it. WHATs are straightforward and easy to define.

**HOW:** Some companies and individuals understand HOW they do WHAT they do. Whether referred to as a “differentiating value proposition,” “proprietary process,” or “unique selling proposition,” HOWs explain what makes something distinct or superior. Less obvious than WHATs, they are often seen as key factors in setting a business apart or influencing decisions.

**WHY:** “Very few people or companies can clearly articulate WHY they do WHAT they do. When I say WHY, I don’t mean to make money—that’s a result. By WHY I mean what is your purpose, cause or belief? WHY does your company exist? WHY do you get out of bed every morning? And WHY should anyone care?”[^2]
