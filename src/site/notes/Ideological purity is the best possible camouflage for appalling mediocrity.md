# Ideological purity is the best possible camouflage for appalling mediocrity

Ideologues tend to elevate adherence to their ideology above categorical excellence. Thus, they will praise and condone what is mediocre because it adheres to their dogma and in spite of its lesser quality. Said differently:

> Ideological purity is the best possible camouflage for appalling mediocrity.[^1]

Examples:
- Open-source purists touting subpar software as superior because its source code is released under an open license and apart from the inherent quality of the software itself.
- Social activists
