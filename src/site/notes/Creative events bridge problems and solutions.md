# Creative events bridge problems and solutions

Creative solutions to [[Challenges are now open, complex, dynamic, and networked\|complex challenges]] are rarely achieved through random flashes of inspired insight. Instead, they are the result of intentional, iterative exploration and [[Coevolution simultaneously develops the formulation of and solution to a problem\|coevolution]] of the problem space together with the solution space.

> \[A\] creative event occurs ==when a bridge is built between the **problem space** and the **solution space** by the identification of a **key concept**==. Empirical research confirms that expert design involves ==a period of exploration in which problem and solution spaces are unstable until (temporarily) fixed by an emergent bridge which identifies, or frames, a problem-solution pairing==. Studies of expert and master designers suggest that this framing ability is crucial to high-level design. Ideas can be described as the moments when there is a sudden “click” between a view of the problem and a possible solution.[^1]
