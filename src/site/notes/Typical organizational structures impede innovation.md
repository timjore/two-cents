# Typical organizational structures impede innovation

Organizations typically focus on “component-level” innovations that sustain and optimize the existing products for the existing customer. When a systemic change is needed that requires the group to communicate and work together in new ways, these organizational structures impede innovation.

> … ==organizational structures typically facilitate **component-level innovations**==, because most product development organizations consist of subgroups that correspond to a product’s components. Such systems work very well as long as the product’s fundamental architecture does not require change. But, say the authors, ==when architectural technology change is required, **this type of structure impedes innovations** that require people and groups to communicate and work together in new ways.==[^1]

Conley’s Law tells us that [[Systems image their design groups\|systems image their design groups]]. Organizations tend to restructure in order to design and optimize their dominant product, which results in the organizational structure affecting (if not determining) how it can or cannot innovate.

> Because an organization’s structure and how its groups work together may have been established to facilitate the design of its dominant product, the direction of causality may ultimately reverse itself: ==The organization’s structure and the way its groups learn to work together can then affect the way it can and cannot design new products.==[^2]
