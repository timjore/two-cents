# Psychological Safety is a prerequisite for creativity

Creativity is risky.
If people don’t feel safe, they won’t take risks.
Ergo, psychological safety in a team is a prerequisite for creativity.

> When the creative well runs dry, it’s the rare leader who points the blame toward something as squishy as psychological safety. Yet creative risk-taking demands it. If people don’t feel safe, they won’t take risks. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.[^1]
