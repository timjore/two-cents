# Agreement is a spectrum, not a binary

We tend to assume (and act) as though agreement and disagreement are the only two options available to a given course of action. If we agree, we support and do it; if we disagree, we do not. It is more helpful to recognize at least four responses that are possible

1. I ==agree unconditionally==.
2. I ==agree, but with some reservations==. However, I have expressed my reservations and feel I have been heard by the group, so I can go forward in peace.
3. I ==don't agree, but I can support== the decision made by those who have more credibility on this topic, are more affected by this decision, or who have greater certainty.
4. No, I ==don't agree and cannot go forward==. In order for me to support this, we will need to spend more time in dialogue.
