# Systems cannot be held in an optimal state

The standard practice of attempting to achieve [[Optimization aims to hold a system in an optimal state\|system optimization]] by holding a system in an optimal state is contrary to the intrinsic nature of systems.

> The history of ecology, economics, and sociology is full of examples showing that the systems around us, ==the systems we are a part of, are **much more complex than our assumptions allow for**==. What it all adds up to is that ==**there is no sustainable “optimal” state of an ecosystem**, a social system, or the world==. It is an illusion, a product of the way we look at and model the world. It is unattainable; in fact (as we shall see) it is counterproductive, and yet it is a widely pursued goal. It is little wonder, then, that problems arise.[^1]

When problems arise, people tend to not question the model itself, but to exert even greater control over the system, which tends to make the problem worse:

>…rather than question the validity of the model being applied, ==the response has been to attempt to **exert even greater control over the system**==. In most cases this exacerbates the problem or leaves us with a solution that comes with too high a cost to be sustained.[^2]
