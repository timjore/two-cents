# Forcefulness can be an unrealized defensive strategy

Senge tells of one “forceful CEO” who lamented the absence of “real leaders” and visionaries in his organization. He was unaware that his ability to communicate tended to have an overpowering effect that made his people look compliant by comparison

> In fact, ==he is so brilliant at articulating his vision that he intimidates everyone around him. Consequently, his views rarely get challenged publicly.== People have learned not to express their own views and visions around him. While he would not see his own ==forcefulness as a defensive strategy==, if he looked carefully, he would see that it functions in exactly that way. ([230](file:///Users/timj/Dropbox/Library/Book/The%20Fifth%20Discipline_Senge_2010.pdf)) ch. 11
