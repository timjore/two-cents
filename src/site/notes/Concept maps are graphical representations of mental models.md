# Concept maps are graphical representations of mental models

A concept map is a graphical tool for structuring and organizing knowledge. It graphically ==represents a mental model by linking elements to one another==. Entities are linked together to depict their relationships in way that is both objective (in that it reflects reality) and subjective (in the selection of entities and relationships to represent):

> Specifically, a concept map will form connections between entities (nouns) by describing relationships (verbs). The map ==provides a visual way to understand relationships== through literal connections as well as through proximity, size, shape, and scale. As an artifact, the map is intended to illustrate relationships. As a methodology, the act of creation is generative and critical. The designer must make subjective value judgments in both selecting the items to include on the map and in indicating the relative strength of the relationships between items.

A concept map “represents the creators' mental model of a concept, but it ==also informs and shapes that mental model during creation==, as it allows designers to see both the holistic scale of the concept and also critical details within the concept.”[^3]
