# Lateral thinking is range in action

In _Lateral Thinking: Creativity Step by Step_, Edward de Bono described ==a manner of solving problems using an indirect and creative approach== via reasoning that is not immediately obvious. It involves ideas that may not be obtainable using only traditional step-by-step logic.[^1]

Epstein notes in *[[References/Range – Epstein (2019)\|Range]]* that lateral thinking is a term that describes “the reimagining of information in new contexts, including ==the drawing together of seemingly disparate concepts or domains that can give old ideas new uses==.“”

As Guillén observes:

> Breakthroughs occur not when someone works within the established paradigm but when assumptions are abandoned, rules are ignored, and creativity runs amok.[^2]
