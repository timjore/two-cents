# Post hoc ergo propter hoc

Post hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin: **"after this, therefore because of this"**) is an informal fallacy that states: "Since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X." It is often shortened simply to **post hoc fallacy**.

Post hoc is a particularly tempting error because **correlation appears to suggest causality.** The fallacy lies in a conclusion based solely on the order of events, rather than taking into account other factors potentially responsible for the result that might rule out the connection.

A simple example is “the rooster crows immediately before sunrise; therefore the rooster causes the sun to rise.“
