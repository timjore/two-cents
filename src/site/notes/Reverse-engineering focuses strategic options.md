# Reverse-engineering focuses strategic options

When considering strategic options, a team may benefit from reverse-engineering the options they are considering.[^1]

1. ﻿﻿﻿**Frame the choice** – Convert issues into at least two mutually independent options that might resolve the problem.
2. ﻿﻿﻿**Generate strategic possibilities** – Broaden the list to ensure consideration of an inclusive list of possibilities.
3. ﻿﻿﻿**Specify conditions** – For each possibility, specify which conditions must hold true for it to be strategically sound.
4. ﻿﻿﻿**Identify barriers to choice** – Determine which conditions you feel least confident are true.
5. ﻿﻿﻿**Design valid tests** – For each key barrier, design a valid test sufficient for generating commitment.
6. ﻿﻿﻿**Conduct tests** – Conduct hypothesis-driven analysis, testing the conditions with the lowest confidence first.
7. ﻿﻿﻿**Choose** – Compare test results to key conditions, and make informed choices.
