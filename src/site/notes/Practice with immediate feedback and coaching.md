# Practice with immediate feedback and coaching

Grenny illustrates deliberate practice with the story of a young girl learning to ski jump, noting the role of the coach in focusing the practice at the edge of her ability, with emphasis on one or two key skills, followed by immediate feedback that sets her up for increased learning on the next run.

> … immediately after her performance, the coach tells her what to do differently the next time and immediately has her take another run. ==The more **immediate the feedback and next attempt**, the more accelerated the learning==.[^1]
