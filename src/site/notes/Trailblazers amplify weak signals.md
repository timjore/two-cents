# Trailblazers amplify weak signals

Innovators tend to intentionally develop “perceptual routines” that help them see what others might miss. One of these routines is the amplification of weak signals. Hamel notes:

> In building a theory of innovation, I talked to dozens of trailblazers. They weren't all super-smart, or artistically inclined, or the product of an unconventional upbringing. But ==all of them had **developed perceptual routines that helped them see beyond the ordinary**—by turning industry dogma on its head, by **amplifying weak signals**, by exploiting competencies and assets, and by tuning in to customer emotions.==[^1]
