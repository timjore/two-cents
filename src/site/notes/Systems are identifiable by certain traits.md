# Systems are identifiable by certain traits

Systems are different from random conglomerations of things in that there because of four key factors that can be identified by the following questions:[^1]

A) Can you identify **parts**?
B) Do the **parts affect each other**?
C) Do the **parts together produce an effect that is different** from the effect of each part on its own?  
D) Does the effect, the **behavior over time, persist** in a variety of circumstances?
