# Lateral thinking with withered technology

In *[[References/Range – Epstein (2019)\|Range]]*, Epstein recounts how Gunpei Yokoi (of Nintendo fame) approached innovation:

> Yokoi embarked on an approach he called “[[Lateral thinking is range in action\|Lateral thinking is range in action]] with withered technology.” ==Lateral thinking is a term coined in the 1960s for the **reimagining of information in new contexts**, including the drawing together of seemingly disparate concepts or domains that can give old ideas new uses.== By “withered technology,” Yokoi meant ==tech that was old enough to be extremely well understood and easily available==, so it didn’t require a specialist’s knowledge. The heart of his philosophy was putting cheap, simple technology to use in ways no one else considered. **If he could not think more deeply about new technologies, he decided, he would think more broadly about old ones.**
