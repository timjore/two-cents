# Teachers of a tradition tend to resist its correction

The teachers of an established tradition are the second to last group of people ==to learn **the truth that corrects it**.== The last to learn it are **those who depend on the teachers to tell them what is true**.

Why is this? There are several reasons, including:

- [[It is difficult to make someone understand what their salary depends on them not understanding\|It is difficult to make someone understand what their salary depends on them not understanding]]
- [[It is impossible to teach a man what he thinks he already knows\|It is impossible to teach a man what he thinks he already knows]]
- [[Motivated reasoning is the soldier mindset\|Motivated reasoning is the soldier mindset]]
- [[Paradigms can have phenomenal longevity\|Paradigms can have phenomenal longevity]]



Futhermore, teachers tend to—by virtue of their gifting—work to iron out the systemic variations and inefficiencies in their domain, in order to teach a cohesive system. But this [[Efficiency is purchased by a loss in flexibility\|efficiency is purchased by a loss in flexibility]].

Ultimately, ==teachers of a tradition tend not to be interested in changing **a paradigm that suits them perfectly**.==
