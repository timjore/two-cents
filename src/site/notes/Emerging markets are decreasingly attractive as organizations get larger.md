# Emerging markets are decreasingly attractive as organizations get larger

The larger an organization gets, the less attractive emerging markets—where disruptive innovations tend to focus—become. 

> But while a $40 million company needs to find just $8 million in revenues to grow at 20 percent in the subsequent year, a $4 billion company needs to find $800 million in new sales. No new markets are that large. As a consequence, the larger and more successful an organization becomes, ==the weaker the argument that **emerging markets can remain useful engines for growth**.==[^1]

Consequently, unless an organization intentionally develops structures and a culture that offset it, organizational growth will cause a trend toward sustaining innovations and rejection of disruptive innovations.
