# Good decision-making does not mix values with facts

Making good decisions requires objectivity and accurate predictive judgments, without skew from values and emotions.

> A widely accepted maxim of good decision making is that ==you should not mix your **values** and your **facts**==. Good decision making must be based on objective and accurate predictive judgments that are completely unaffected by hopes and fears, or by preferences and values.[^1]

Predictive judgments are “involved in every decision, and accuracy should be their only goal. Keep your values and your facts separate.”[^2]
