# Paradigm shifts reconstruct the field from new fundamentals

New paradigms are not cumulative or additive to an existing paradigm—they reconstruct the field afresh. 

> ==The transition from a paradigm in crisis to a new one from which a new tradition of normal science can emerge is **far from a cumulative process**==, one achieved by an articulation or extension of the old paradigm. Rather ==it is a **reconstruction of the field from new fundamentals**==, a reconstruction that changes some of the field’s most elementary theoretical generalizations as well as many of its paradigm methods and applications.[^1]

The reconstruction, however, may result in an overlap between the two during the transition (which, for some paradigms may last a long time).

> ==During the transition period there will be a **large but never complete overlap** between the problems that can be solved by the old and by the new paradigm.== But there will also be a decisive difference in the modes of solution. ==When the transition is complete, the profession will have changed its view of the field, its methods, and its goals.==[^2]
