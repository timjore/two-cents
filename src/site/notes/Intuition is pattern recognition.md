# Intuition is pattern recognition

The more experience a person has in a particular domain, the greater their potential for intuitively making good decisions. Herbert Simon, a scholar in the field of decision making, summarizes this process:

> The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. ==**Intuition is** nothing more and nothing less than **recognition**==.[^1]

Kahneman notes that the moral of Simon’s remark “is that the mystery of knowing without knowing is not a distinctive feature of intuition; it is the norm of mental life.”[^2]
