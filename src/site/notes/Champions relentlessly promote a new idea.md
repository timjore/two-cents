# Champions relentlessly promote a new idea

In order for a decentralized organization to succeed, the Catalyst (initiator and explainer of the idea) cedes leadership to the Champion, who relentlessly promotes the idea and recruits others to join it.

> ==A champion is **relentless in promoting a new idea**==. Catalysts are charismatic, but champions take it to the next level. A catalyst’s charisma … has a subtlety to it. ==Catalysts inspire and naturally connect people, but there’s nothing subtle about the champion.==[^1]
