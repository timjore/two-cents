# Frame creation develops a plan for transformation

As frames are discovered that promise fruitful results, designers develop plans for implementation, together with a transformation agenda and strategy for achieving results.

> The next step is a ==critical evaluation of what frames and solution directions would be feasible in the short term, or can be established gradually over a longer period of time==. Here the representation of ideas becomes important as a means to explore their merit in conversations with parties in the field. … At this point we also grudgingly have to ==weed out frames and ideas that may be great in themselves, but whose implementation would require huge changes in the practices of a stakeholder who has very little to gain==. These frames need to go because they will never happen. This step results in ==a “business plan” accompanied by a **transformation agenda** and a **strategy** for achieving results==.[^1]

The [[Frame creation resolves complex problems in nine steps\|nine steps]] of frame creation:
1. [[Frame creation begins with investigation\|Archaeology]] – Investigate who has already tried what to solve the problem.
2. [[Frame creation requires understanding the core paradox\|Paradox]] – Understand the core paradox of the problem.
3. [[Frame creation learns practices and scenarios that may suggest a solution\|Context]] – Learn practices and scenarios that may suggest a solution.
4. [[Frame creation considers all stakeholders of the problem and solution\|Field]] – Consider all stakeholders of the problem and solution.
5. [[Frame creation seeks to understand the root factors of stakeholders\|Themes]] – Seek to understand the root factors of stakeholders.
6. [[Frame creation identifies common themes as the basis for frames\|Frames]] – Identify common themes as the basis for frames.
7. [[Frame creation thinks forward to identify solutions\|Futures]] – “Think forward” to identify solutions.
8. **Transformation** – Develop a plan for transformation.
9. [[Frame creation integrates solutions into the stakeholder context\|Integration]] – Integrate solutions into the stakeholder context.
