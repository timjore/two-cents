# Open problems have unclear or permeable borders

Problems traditionally have been defined by clear and impermeable borders. By contrast:

> ==An open problem is one **where the system border is not clear, or where it is permeable**.== It is important to realize that normally when we start out solving a problem we draw a mental circle, nominating things to think about and what to leave out. **Anything beyond the circle we call “context,” and that will not play a part in our thinking about the problem.** Yet in some cases now, we find problem situations in which it is very unclear where this circle should be drawn, where we really cannot say what can be safely excluded and ignored.[^1]
