# Paradigm changes are preceded by awareness and recognition

Certain characteristics tend to result in the discovery of new paradigms. These include: [[Paradigms change when they can no longer address anomalies\|awareness of anomaly]], recognition of the causes of its causes, and the [[New paradigms tend to emerge all at once\|emergence]] of new paradigm categories and procedures.

>  ==the previous **awareness of anomaly**, the gradual and simultaneous emergence of both **observational and conceptual recognition**, and the consequent **change of paradigm categories and procedures** often accompanied by resistance.== There is even evidence that these same characteristics are built into the nature of the perceptual process itself.[^1]
