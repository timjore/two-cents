# Data must be interpreted in context and without noise

Before being used as a basis for action, data have to be interpreted in context and without noise.

> Data are collected as a basis for action. Yet before anyone can use data as a basis for action the data have to be interpreted. ==The proper interpretation of data will require that the data be **presented in context**, and that the analysis technique used will **filter out the noise**.==[^1]

Graphs are “the most powerful tool available for presenting data in context. Among the many graphs possible, the running record and the histogram are the two most useful.”[^2]
