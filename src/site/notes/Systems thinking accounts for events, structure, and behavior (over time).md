# Systems thinking accounts for events, structure, and behavior (over time)

Systems thinking goes beyond merely observing (and reacting to) events and seeks to understand the underlying system structure that produced the events.

> ==Systems thinking goes back and forth constantly between **structure**== (diagrams of stocks, flows, and feedback) ==and **behavior**== (time graphs). Systems thinkers strive to understand the connections between the hand releasing the Slinky (event) and the resulting oscillations (behavior) and the mechanical characteristics of the Slinky’s helical coil (structure).[^1]
