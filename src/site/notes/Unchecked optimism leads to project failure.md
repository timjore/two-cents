# Unchecked optimism leads to project failure

In [[References/How Big Things Get Done – Flyvbjerg and Gardner (2023)\|How Big Things Get Done]], the authors note that key heuristic for managing optimism on projects is “You want the flight attendant, not the pilot, to be an optimist.” They continue:

>  What you need from your pilot, and must insist on, is ==hard-nosed analysis that **sees reality as clearly as possible**==. The same holds for optimism about budgets and schedules on big projects, which are their “fuel readings.” ==Unchecked, optimism leads to unrealistic forecasts, poorly defined goals, better options ignored, problems not spotted and dealt with, and no contingencies to counteract the inevitable surprises.== Yet … optimism routinely displaces hard-nosed analysis in big projects, as in so much else people do.[^1]
