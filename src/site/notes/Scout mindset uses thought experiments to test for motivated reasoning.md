# Scout mindset uses thought experiments to test for motivated reasoning

The scout mindset uses intentional thought experiments to clarify thinking and test for motivated reasoning (rather than “accuracy motivated reasoning”). These include:[^1]

- the **double standard** test: “Am I judging other people’s behavior by a standard I wouldn’t apply to myself?” The double standard test can be applied to groups as well as individuals.
- the **outsider** test: Imagine someone else stepped into your shoes—what do you expect they would do in your situation?
- the **conformity** test: Imagine this person told me that they no longer held this view. Would I still hold it? Would I feel comfortable defending it to them?
- the **selective skeptic** test: Imagine this evidence supported the other side. How credible would you find it then?
- the [[Status quo bias favors the current state\|status quo bias]] test: a motivation to defend whatever situation happens to be the status quo.
