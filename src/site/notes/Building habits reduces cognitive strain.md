# Building habits reduces cognitive strain

Once the desired behaviors are identified and implemented, turning them into habit increases the likelihood that they will persist. Two techniques may be helpful here: **Action triggers** and **Checklists**.

Action triggers are the pre-loading of a decision based on an action, or the environment itself.

> That’s why action triggers have unexpected value. … ==when people pre-decide, they “pass the control of their behavior on to the environment.”==  says that action triggers “protect goals from tempting distractions, bad habits, or competing goals.”[^1]

As detailed in [[References/The Checklist Manifesto – Gawande (2009)\|The Checklist Manifesto – Gawande (2009)]], checklists are immensely helpful for achieving desired outcomes.

> How can something so simple be so powerful? ==Checklists educate people about what’s best, showing them the ironclad right way to do something==. (That means that checklists are effective at directing the Rider.)

Checklists are especially important when navigating change in complex conditions, because [[Checklists ensure success in complex conditions\|Checklists ensure success in complex conditions]].
