# Blame Instinct hinders thinking by pointing fingers

from *[[References/Factfulness – Rosling, et al. (2018)\|Factfulness]]*:

> Factfulness is … recognizing when a scapegoat is being used and remembering that ==**blaming an individual often steals the focus from other possible explanations** and blocks our ability to prevent similar problems in the future.==

To control the blame instinct, ==resist finding a scapegoat==.

- **Look for causes, not villains.** When something goes wrong don’t look for an individual or a group to blame. Accept that *bad things can happen without anyone intending them to*. Instead spend your energy on understanding the multiple interacting causes, or system, that created the situation. (see [[Hanlon's razor avoids paranoia and ideology\|Hanlon's razor avoids paranoia and ideology]])

- **Look for systems, not heroes.** When someone claims to have caused something good, ask whether the outcome might have happened anyway, even if that individual had done nothing. Give the system some credit. (see [[Systems Thinking perceives the relationships and structure of complex systems\|Systems Thinking perceives the relationships and structure of complex systems]])
