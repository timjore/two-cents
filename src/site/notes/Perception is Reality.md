# Perception is Reality

One’s **subjective perception of objective reality** is what determines actions, not the objective reality itself.

> Scenarios deal with two worlds; the world of facts and the world of perceptions. ==They **explore for facts** but they **aim at perceptions** inside the heads of decision- makers.== Their purpose is to gather and transform information of strategic significance into fresh perceptions. —Pierre Wack[^1]
