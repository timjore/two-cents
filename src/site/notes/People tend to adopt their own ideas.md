# People tend to adopt their own ideas

Christopher Nolan’s movie *Inception* explores the “adoption problem”: ==people will usually **adopt their own ideas much more eagerly, actively, and fully** than those of others.==[^1] The story depicts entering someone’s dream in order to achieve inception, described in the words of one character: “I’m just doing what I know how to do. I’m ==putting ideas in your mind, **making you think they’re your own**==.”

> ==**Inception:** planting an idea and watching it grow.== It’s just a simple form of creation.
