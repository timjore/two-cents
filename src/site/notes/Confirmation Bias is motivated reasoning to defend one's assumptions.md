# Confirmation Bias is motivated reasoning to defend one's assumptions

Confirmation bias (or “motivated reasoning”) is the tendency to search for, interpret, focus on and remember information in a way that confirms one’s assumptions and preconceptions.

> ==The human tendency to look for information which confirms preexisting beliefs.== When cognitive dissonance arises, we aim to realign our worldviews. **Overcoming confirmation bias is a huge step towards making better choices motivated by logic**, not emotions. Hanlon’s razor assists with this. If we expect malicious intent, we are likely to attribute it wherever possible. For example, if someone sees a certain politician as corrupt, they will look for information which confirms that. They become unable to identify when mistakes are the result of incompetence or accident.
