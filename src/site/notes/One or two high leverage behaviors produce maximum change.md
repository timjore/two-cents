# One or two high leverage behaviors produce maximum change

Bringing about much-needed change often does not require solving the entire problem or implementing a complex set of actions. Instead, it requires identifying the small number of high-leverage behaviors that brings about the greatest amount of change.

> It turns out that even with very complex problems, ==often **just one or two behaviors produce the greatest amount of change**==. … Effective leaders understand that influence is about changing behavior. They set themselves up for success by clearly identifying the one or two actions that, if practiced consistently, will create a cascade of change.[^1]

The tendency to try to solve big problems with big solutions is common, but flawed.

> This is a theme you will see again and again. ==Big problems are rarely solved with commensurately big solutions==. Instead, ==they are most often solved by **a sequence of small solutions**==, sometimes over weeks, sometimes over decades. And this asymmetry is why the Rider’s predilection for analysis can backfire so easily.[^2]

One of the most straightforward means of identifying the high-leverage behaviors is to identify those who are not aligned with the status quo.

> So how do you find these disproportionately effective habits if they’re not glaringly evident? The most efficient way is by studying something called “[[Bright spots show positive deviance\|positive deviance]].”[^3]
