# Antifragile Systems

An antifragile system is ==a system that **becomes stronger and more resilient** in response to stressors, shocks, or disturbances==. The concept of antifragility is the opposite of fragility, where a system becomes weaker or breaks down in response to stressors. Antifragile systems are necessarily ==[[Complex Systems\|complex systems]] that are composed of fragile elements==, whose breaks and failures provide the means of strengthening the system as a whole.

Examples of antifragility can be found in natural systems such as living organisms, ecological systems, and economies.

> Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. ==The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; **the antifragile gets better**.==

> The antifragile loves randomness and uncertainty, which also means crucially—a love of errors, a certain class of errors. Antifragility has a singular property of allowing us to deal with the unknown, to do things without understanding them—and do them well. Let me be more aggressive: we are largely better at doing than we are at thinking, thanks to antifragility.
