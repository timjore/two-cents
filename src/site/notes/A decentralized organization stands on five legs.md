# A decentralized organization stands on five legs

All decentralized organizations are alike in important ways and the most successful ones have five key characteristics.

> A decentralized organization stands on five legs. As with the starfish, it can lose a leg or two and still survive. But ==when you have all the legs working together, a decentralized organization can really take off==.

The five legs of a decentralized organization:

1. [[Leg 1: Circles\|Leg 1: Circles]] – Leadership is by circles in decentralized organizations
2. [[Leg 2: The Catalyst\|Leg 2: The Catalyst]] – A catalyst starts and moves on from a decentralized organization
3. [[Leg 3: Ideology\|Leg 3: Ideology]] – Ideology is the glue that holds decentralized organizations together
4. [[Leg 4: The Pre-existing Network\|Leg 4: The Pre-existing Network]] – Decentralized organizations emerge from networks
5. [[Leg 5: The Champion\|Leg 5: The Champion]] – Champions relentlessly promote a new idea
