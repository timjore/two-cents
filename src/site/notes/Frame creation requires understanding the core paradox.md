# Frame creation requires understanding the core paradox

After [[Frame creation begins with investigation\|Archaeology]], in which we discover the “succession of actions that led to the problem situation has been defined and there is a clear understanding of what drives the organizational behavior of the problem owner,” we move on to the second step in frame creation. Here, we “==investigate the initial problem definition itself. The lead question is: What makes this problem hard to solve?== Often, several issues are intertwined in a problem situation, but to keep the frame creation process on track, it is important to ==take some time to **identify the core paradox or deadlock that keeps the problem owner from moving forward**==.”[^1]

The [[Frame creation resolves complex problems in nine steps\|nine steps]] of frame creation:
1. [[Frame creation begins with investigation\|Archaeology]] – Investigate who has already tried what to solve the problem.
2. **Paradox** – Understand the core paradox of the problem.
3. [[Frame creation learns practices and scenarios that may suggest a solution\|Context]] – Learn practices and scenarios that may suggest a solution.
4. [[Frame creation considers all stakeholders of the problem and solution\|Field]] – Consider all stakeholders of the problem and solution.
5. [[Frame creation seeks to understand the root factors of stakeholders\|Themes]] – Seek to understand the root factors of stakeholders.
6. [[Frame creation identifies common themes as the basis for frames\|Frames]] – Identify common themes as the basis for frames.
7. [[Frame creation thinks forward to identify solutions\|Futures]] – “Think forward” to identify solutions.
8. [[Frame creation develops a plan for transformation\|Transformation]] – Develop a plan for transformation.
9. [[Frame creation integrates solutions into the stakeholder context\|Integration]] – Integrate solutions into the stakeholder context.
