# Superforecasters think differently

In *[[References/Superforecasting – Tetlock, Gardner (2015)\|Superforecasting]]*, Tetlock and Gardner describe what makes “superforecasters” so much more effective in predicting future events.

In philosophic outlook, they tend to be: 
- **CAUTIOUS**: Nothing is certain 
- **HUMBLE**: Reality is infinitely complex 
- **NONDETERMINISTIC**: What happens is not meant to be and does not have to happen

In their abilities and thinking styles, they tend to be: 
- **ACTIVELY OPEN-MINDED**: Beliefs are hypotheses to be tested, not treasures to be protected 
- **INTELLIGENT AND KNOWLEDGEABLE, WITH A “NEED FOR COGNITION”**: Intellectually curious, enjoy puzzles and mental challenges 
- **REFLECTIVE**: Introspective and self-critical 
- **NUMERATE**: Comfortable with numbers

In their methods of forecasting they tend to be: 
- **PRAGMATIC**: Not wedded to any idea or agenda 
- **ANALYTICAL**: Capable of stepping back from the tip-of-your-nose perspective and considering other views 
- **DRAGONFLY-EYED**: Value diverse views and synthesize them into their own 
- **PROBABILISTIC**: Judge using many grades of maybe 
- **THOUGHTFUL UPDATERS**: When facts change, they change their minds 
- **GOOD INTUITIVE PSYCHOLOGISTS**: Aware of the value of checking thinking for cognitive and emotional biases[^1]

In their work ethic, they tend to have: 
- **A GROWTH MINDSET**: Believe it’s possible to get better[^2]
- **GRIT**: Determined to keep at it however long it takes[^3]

The “10 Commandments” of Superforecasting (for more details, visit www.goodjudgment.com).[^4]

**(1) Triage.**

> ==Focus on questions where your hard work is likely to pay off==. Don’t waste time either on easy “clocklike” questions (where simple rules of thumb can get you close to the right answer) or on impenetrable “cloud-like” questions (where even fancy statistical models can’t beat the dart-throwing chimp). Concentrate on questions in the Goldilocks zone of difficulty, where effort pays off the most.
> …
> Bear in mind the two basic errors it is possible to make here. We could fail to try to predict the potentially predictable or we could waste our time trying to predict the unpredictable. Which error would be worse in the situation you face?

**(2) Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable subproblems.**

> ==Decompose the problem into its knowable and unknowable parts==. Flush ignorance into the open. Expose and examine your assumptions. Dare to be wrong by making your best guesses. Better to discover errors quickly than to hide them behind vague verbiage.

**(3) Strike the right balance between inside and outside views.**

> Superforecasters know that there is nothing new under the sun. Nothing is 100% “unique.” Language purists be damned: uniqueness is a matter of degree. So superforecasters ==conduct creative searches for comparison classes even for seemingly unique events==, such as the outcome of a hunt for a high-profile terrorist (Joseph Kony) or the standoff between a new socialist government in Athens and Greece’s creditors. Superforecasters are in the habit of posing the outside-view question: How often do things of this sort happen in situations of this sort?

**(4) Strike the right balance between under and overreacting to evidence.**

> ==Belief updating is to good forecasting as brushing and flossing are to good dental hygiene==. It can be boring, occasionally uncomfortable, but it pays off in the long term. That said, don’t suppose that belief updating is always easy because it sometimes is. Skillful updating requires teasing subtle signals from noisy news flows—all the while resisting the lure of wishful thinking.

**(5) Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem.**

> In classical dialectics, thesis meets antithesis, producing synthesis. In dragonfly eye, one view meets another and another and another—all of which must be synthesized into a single image. There are no paint-by-number rules here. ==Synthesis is an art that requires reconciling irreducibly subjective judgments.== If you do it well, engaging in this process of synthesizing should transform you from a cookie-cutter dove or hawk into an odd hybrid creature, a dove-hawk, with a nuanced view of when tougher or softer policies are likelier to work. 

**(6) Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more.**

> Few things are either certain or impossible. And “maybe” isn’t all that informative. So your uncertainty dial needs more than three settings. Nuance matters. ==The more degrees of uncertainty you can distinguish, the better a forecaster you are likely to be.== As in poker, you have an advantage if you are better than your competitors at separating 60/40 bets from 40/60—or 55/45 from 45/55. Translating vague-verbiage hunches into numeric probabilities feels unnatural at first but it can be done. It just requires patience and practice. The superforecasters have shown what is possible.

**(7) Strike the right balance between underand overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness.**

> ==Superforecasters understand the risks both of rushing to judgment and of dawdling too long near “maybe.”== They routinely manage the trade-off between the need to take decisive stands (who wants to listen to a waffler?) and the need to qualify their stands (who wants to listen to a blowhard?). They realize that long-term accuracy requires getting good scores on both calibration and resolution— which requires moving beyond blame-game ping-pong. It is not enough just to avoid the most recent mistake. They have to find creative ways to tamp down both types of forecasting errors— misses and false alarms—to the degree a fickle world permits such uncontroversial improvements in accuracy.

**(8) Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases.**

> ==Don’t try to justify or excuse your failures. Own them!== Conduct unflinching postmortems: Where exactly did I go wrong? And remember that although the more common error is to learn too little from failure and to overlook flaws in your basic assumptions, it is also possible to learn too much (you may have been basically on the right track but made a minor technical mistake that had big ramifications). Also don’t forget to do postmortems on your successes too. Not all successes imply that your reasoning was right. You may have just lucked out by making offsetting errors. And if you keep confidently reasoning along the same lines, you are setting yourself up for a nasty surprise.

**(9) Bring out the best in others and let others bring out the best in you.**

> ==Master the fine arts of team management, especially perspective taking== (understanding the arguments of the other side so well that you can reproduce them to the other’s satisfaction), precision
> 
> …questioning (helping others to clarify their arguments so they are not misunderstood), and constructive confrontation (learning to disagree without being disagreeable). Wise leaders know how fine the line can be between a helpful suggestion and micromanagerial meddling or between a rigid group and a decisive one or between a scatterbrained group and an open-minded one.

**(10) Master the error-balancing bicycle.**

> ==Implementing each commandment requires balancing opposing errors==. Just as you can’t learn to ride a bicycle by reading a physics textbook, you can’t become a superforecaster by reading training manuals. Learning requires doing, with good feedback that leaves no ambiguity about whether you are succeeding—“I’m rolling along smoothly!”—or whether you are failing—“crash!” Also remember that practice is not just going through the motions of making forecasts, or casually reading the news and tossing out probabilities. Like all other known forms of expertise, superforecasting is the product of deep, deliberative practice.

(11) Don’t treat commandments as commandments.

> Guidelines are the best we can do in a world where nothing is certain or exactly repeatable. ==Superforecasting requires constant mindfulness==, even when—perhaps especially when—you are dutifully trying to follow these commandments.
