# General resilience depends on diversity, modularity, and feedbacks

The general resilience of a system refers to its ability to withstand  disturbances that the system has never encountered before. It is affected by three factors:

> What confers general resilience? Studies of a variety of social-ecological systems … suggest ==three factors that probably play an important role in maintaining it are **[[Diversity of a system affects resilience\|diversity]]**, **[[Modularity of a system affects resilience\|modularity]]**, and the **[[Staging/Tightness of feedback loops affects a system’s resilience\|tightness of feedbacks]]**==—all key features identified for ecosystems.[^1]
