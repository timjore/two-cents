# Decentralized systems can grow quickly

The highly adaptable and resilient nature of decentralized systems enables it to scale up rapidly. As each node multiples additional nodes that are aligned with the purpose and parameters of the system (it’s DNA), the growth progression is geometric, not linear.

> … the fifth principle of decentralization: ==the decentralized organization sneaks up on you==. Because the decentralized organization mutates so quickly, ==it can also **grow incredibly quickly**==.[^1]

Principles of decentralization:
1. [[When attacked, decentralized systems tend to become moreso\|When attacked, decentralized systems tend to become moreso]]
2. [[Decentralized systems are easily mistaken for centralized systems\|Decentralized systems are easily mistaken for centralized systems]]
3. [[Intelligence is spread throughout decentralized systems\|Intelligence is spread throughout decentralized systems]]
4. [[Decentralized systems can adapt rapidly\|Decentralized systems can adapt rapidly]]
5. Decentralized systems can grow quickly
6. [[Decentralization of industries tends to lower profits\|Decentralization of industries tends to lower profits]]
