# Ideaflow is the single most important creative metric

> ==The most useful measure of creativity we’ve found is as follows: **the number of novel ideas a person or group can generate around a given problem in a given amount of time**. We call this metric **ideaflow**.== An organization with low ideaflow is in trouble because it’s running out of an essential resource
