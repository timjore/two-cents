# Ideaflow is the single most important creative metric

`ideas / time = ideaflow`

> ==The most useful measure of creativity we’ve found is as follows: **the number of novel ideas a person or group can generate around a given problem in a given amount of time**. We call this metric **ideaflow**.== An organization with low ideaflow is in trouble because it’s running out of an essential resource.[^1]


> As a metric, ideaflow is a simple gauge of the relative health of your creative engine or that of a team. ==The only value in measuring it lies in comparing your current score to previous and future ones.== It looks like this: **ideas / time = ideaflow**[^2]
