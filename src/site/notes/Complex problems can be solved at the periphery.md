# Complex problems can be solved at the periphery

The default tendency of most leaders when faced with a complex problem is to increase control and centralization. But an ”entirely different philosophy about power and what should happen to it when you’re confronted with complex, nonroutine problems” is proving to be much more effective: push power from the center to the periphery.

> The philosophy is that you ==push the power of decision making out to the periphery and away from the center. You **give people the room to adapt, based on their experience and expertise**.== All you ask is that they talk to one another and take responsibility. That is what works.[^1]
