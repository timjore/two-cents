# Strategy is the answer to five questions

Lafley and Martin define strategy as the answer to these five interrelated questions:[^1]

1. **[[Strategy is focused on a winning aspiration\|What is your winning aspiration?]]** The purpose of your enterprise, its motivating aspiration. 
2. **[[Strategy narrows the competitive field\|Where will you play?]]** A playing field where you can achieve that aspiration. 
3. **[[Strategy defines the choices for winning in a chosen field\|How will you win?]]** The way you will win on the chosen playing field. 
4. **[[Strategy identifies capabilities needed for winning in a chosen field\|What capabilities must be in place?]]** The set and configuration of capabilities required to win in the chosen way. 
5. **[[Strategy identifies management systems needed for winning\|What management systems are required?]]** The systems and measures that enable the capabilities and support the choices.

> These choices and the relationship between them can be understood as a reinforcing cascade, with ==the choices at the top of the cascade **setting the context** for the choices below==, and ==choices at the bottom **influencing and refining** the choices above==.[^2]
