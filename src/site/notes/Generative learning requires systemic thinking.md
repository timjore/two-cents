# Generative learning requires systemic thinking

High-performance teams require the ability to think systemically in order to discover structural causes of behavior. This generative learning enables them to shape the structures so as to optimize for desired outcomes.

> Generative learning cannot be sustained in an organization where event thinking predominates. ==It requires a conceptual framework of “structural” or systemic thinking, the **ability to discover structural causes of behavior**.== Enthusiasm for “creating our future” is not enough.[^1]
