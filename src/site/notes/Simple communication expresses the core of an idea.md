# Simple communication expresses the core of an idea

_How do we find the essential core of our ideas?_ 

> **To strip an idea down to its core, ==we must be masters of exclusion. We must relentlessly prioritize==.** Saying something short is not the mission—sound bites are not the ideal. Proverbs are the ideal. **We must create ideas that are both simple and profound.** The Golden Rule is the ultimate model of simplicity: a one-sentence statement so profound that an individual could spend a lifetime learning to follow it.[^1]

Good communication **finds the core** + **shares the core**. ==Simple = core + compact==.[^2]
