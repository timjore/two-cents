# Complexifying overcomes binary bias

Binary bias is the “basic human tendency to seek clarity and closure by **simplifying a complex continuum into two categories**.”[^2] In order to overcome this tendency, one may complexify the topic by showing a broader range of points on the spectrum. From *Think Again*:

> ==An antidote to this proclivity is complexifying: showcasing the range of perspectives on a given topic.== We might believe we’re making progress by discussing hot-button issues as two sides of a coin, but people are actually more inclined to think again if we present these topics through the many lenses of a prism.
