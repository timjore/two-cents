# Problem-solving follows a four step process

Solving problems (including [[Paradigms change when they can no longer address anomalies\|shifting a paradigm]]) tend to follow four steps:

1. **Recognize the problem** – This includes acknowledging that the current approach (strategy, paradigm, etc) is failing.
2. **Discover the cause** – This involves seeking to understand the system as a whole in order to understand the context and dynamics of the factors and forces constraining the system and causing the problem(s).
3. **Address the cause** – Adjust the system so as to relax or change the constraints that cause the problem(s).
4. **Identify the solution** – The process of trial and error may require perseverance, but eventually produces a change (or series of changes) that resolves the problem.

> a four step process leads to an insight, which only seems to appear instantly: The ==current problem solving strategy fails== to yield a solution, given the existing constraints. There is a ==tacit consideration of the new constraints== in the strategy. The ==constraints are relaxed (or changed) in a new way==, thus broadening the problem space and allowing for further consideration. Many changes in constraints lead nowhere, but, with perseverance, ==a change may be made that leads at once to a solution of the problem==.
