# New paradigms are incommensurable with previous ones

New paradigms cannot be understood by those who are in the old. The lexicon itself is no longer usable across paradigms, and debates between paradigms [[Paradigm arguments are circular\|tend to be circular]].

> The normal-scientific ==tradition that emerges from a scientific revolution is not only incompatible but often actually **incommensurable with that which has gone before**==.[^1]
