# Selection Bias happens when the sample is not representative

When testing an idea (e.g., a new product or process), conventional wisdom holds that it is important to start small and then to scale up if the idea succeeds. But an often-overlooked risk is necessarily associated with this approach: **the sample that is tested in the “start small” phase may not be representative of the entire population** within the intended scope of impact of the idea.


> To truly achieve widespread impact, it’s not enough to understand how your current customers or audience differs across geographies, demographic groups, and so on. ==You also need to think about how your current audience might differ from your future one.==
>
> Put another way, is the initial audience—or test subjects, or market segment—that yielded your early success a representative snapshot of the larger group of people whom you hope to serve at scale? When looking at results in the early stages of any enterprise, ==you must check that you’re correctly gauging what scientists call the **representativeness of population**==.
>
> Non-representativeness can occur either accidentally or through willful selection of the sample. When it occurs accidentally, it is a phenomenon known as ==selection bias—**when people opt in to programs in a non-random way**. This is problematic because **people who choose to participate in a pilot program or study are the most likely to benefit**.==
> …
> The big-picture lesson here is one you ignore at your own peril: ==when assessing early responses to your idea, look under the hood and **make sure the people in that group are representative of the larger population** you ultimately hope to reach.== To uncover true actionable knowledge, it is important to recognize heterogeneities rather than hide them.[^1]
