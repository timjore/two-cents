# A catalyst starts and moves on from a decentralized organization

A Catalyst is ==**the initiator of a new idea** around which a decentralized organization may form==. Catalysts are unique from founders in that a founder is often driven by a sense of identity that is derived (and shaped by, dependent on, etc.) the organization that they start. 

A Catalyst, by contrast, is motivated by the idea itself, and sees the organization as the (and perhaps only “a”) means by which the vision can be achieved. Thus, “a catalyst gets a decentralized organization going and then cedes control to the members.”[^1]

> ==In letting go of the leadership role, the catalyst transfers ownership and responsibility to the circle.== … A catalyst isn’t usually in it for praise and accolades. When his or her job is done, a catalyst knows it’s time to move on. … ==A catalyst develops an idea, shares it with others, and leads by example.== A catalyst is like the architect of a house: he’s essential to the long-term structural integrity, but he doesn’t move in. In fact, when the catalyst stays around too long and becomes absorbed in his creation, the whole structure becomes more centralized.[^2]

Catalysts lead in fundamentally different ways from typical corporate hierarchies, and their type of leadership is not ideal for all situations.

> ==Catalysts are bound to rock the boat. They are much better at being **agents of change** than guardians of tradition. **Catalysts do well in situations that call for radical change and creative thinking**. They bring innovation, but **they’re also likely to create a certain amount of chaos and ambiguity.**== Put them into a structured environment, and they might suffocate. But let them dream and they’ll thrive.
