# Coevolution simultaneously develops the formulation of and solution to a problem

Expert designers develop and refine both “the formulation of a problem and ideas for a solution in concert” in a process called “coevolution.”[^1]

> In expert design practice, research has shown that the design problem is not fixed before the search begins for a satisfactory solution concept. … ==Coevolution involves a **constant iteration** of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation passing back and forth between the two conceptual design “spaces”—the problem space and the solution space==. … the designer is seeking to ==generate a **matching problem-solution pair**==.[^2]

The essential process generally follows this pattern:[^3]

1. A chunk, or seed, of **coherent information** arises from the problem situation.
2. It sparks the **crystallization of a core solution** idea (the “primary generator”).
3. This core solution idea in turn **changes the designer’s view** of the problem situation.
4. **Redefine the problem** in light of the possible solution.
5. They then **check** whether the new problem definition still suits the earlier solution idea.

The creative process of design is generally not so much, as the popular perception depicts, a flash of sudden inspiration as an iterative process of exploration. The intent of the designer, then, is to achieve a creative event by [[Creative events bridge problems and solutions\|bridging the problem space and the solution space]] by the identification of a key concept. Once problem and solution “fit together nicely, the result takes on an unassailable quality: ==a structure emerges that is **simple and coherent and that integrates all the demands** that had occupied the initial, messy problem arena==.”[^4]
