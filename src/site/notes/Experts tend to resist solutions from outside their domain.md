# Experts tend to resist solutions from outside their domain

> If you would like an easy life, ==never come up with a solution to a problem that is drawn from **a field of expertise other than that from which it is assumed the solution will arise**.== … science seems to fall short of its ideals whenever the theoretical elegance of the solution or the intellectual credentials of the solver are valued above the practicality of an idea. …If ==a problem is solved using a discipline other than that practised by **those who believe themselves the rightful guardians of the solution**==, you’ll face an uphill struggle no matter how much evidence you can amass. … All too often, what matters is not whether an idea is true or effective, but whether it fits with the preconceptions of a dominant cabal. … The question being asked seemed to be, ‘Yes I know it works in practice, **but does it work in theory?**’[^1]
