# Elastic Thinking can hold two contradictory ideas simultaneously

The pursuit of truth often requires exploration of contradictory ideas at the same time, weighing them against each other. This [[Staging/Paradox Mindset\|Paradox Mindset]] is not always a comfortable activity.

> Before I go on with this short history let me make a general observation—==the test of a first-rate intelligence is **the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function**.== One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise. This philosophy fitted on to my early adult life, when I saw the improbable, the implausible, often the “impossible” come true. —F. Scott Fitzgerald[^1]
