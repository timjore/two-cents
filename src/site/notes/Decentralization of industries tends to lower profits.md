# Decentralization of industries tends to lower profits

When an economic system moves from centralized to decentralized (which generally correlates to moving from [[Cynefin framework helps interpret systems\|complicated to complex]]), the overall profits decrease. When an industry is centralized (i.e., a monopoly), the profit margins can be much higher than when the industry is governed by supply and demand from multiple providers.

> … the sixth principle of decentralization: ==as industries become decentralized, **overall profits decrease**==. Introduce starfish into the equation and wave good-bye to high profits. It’s why you want to be on the lookout for any starfish before they take an industry by storm.[^1]

Principles of decentralization:
1. [[When attacked, decentralized systems tend to become moreso\|When attacked, decentralized systems tend to become moreso]]
2. [[Decentralized systems are easily mistaken for centralized systems\|Decentralized systems are easily mistaken for centralized systems]]
3. [[Intelligence is spread throughout decentralized systems\|Intelligence is spread throughout decentralized systems]]
