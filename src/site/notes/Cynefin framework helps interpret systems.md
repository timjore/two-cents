# Cynefin framework helps interpret systems

Cynefin is ==a sense-making framework for identifying and understanding the kind of problem space== you are in, so as to guide decision-making and action.

- **Simple and complicated contexts assume an ordered universe**, where *cause-and-effect relationships are perceptible, and right answers can be determined based on the facts*. 
- **Complex and chaotic contexts are unordered**—*there is no immediately apparent relationship between cause and effect, and the way forward is determined based on emerging patterns.* 

The ordered world is the world of fact-based management; **the unordered world represents ==pattern-based management==.**

## ==Clear== (or Simple) Contexts: The Domain of Best Practice

Simple contexts are ==characterized by stability and clear cause-and-effect relationships== that are easily discernible by everyone.

## ==Complicated== Contexts: The Domain of Experts

Complicated contexts, unlike simple ones, ==may contain multiple right answers==, and though there is a clear relationship between cause and effect, not everyone can see it.

## ==Complex== Contexts: The Domain of Emergence

In a complicated context, at least one right answer exists. In a complex context, however, ==right answers can’t be ferreted out==.

Furthermore, solutions to complex problems are bespoke and so cannot be systematized or optimized, as in the example of raising children:

> Complex problems are ones like raising a child. Once you learn how to send a rocket to the moon, you can repeat the process with other rockets and perfect it. One rocket is like another rocket. But not so with raising a child …. Every child is unique. ==Although raising one child may provide experience, **it does not guarantee success with the next child**.==[^3]

## ==Chaotic== Contexts: The Domain of Rapid Response

In a chaotic context, searching for right answers would be pointless: The ==relationships between cause and effect are impossible to determine== because they shift constantly and no manageable patterns
