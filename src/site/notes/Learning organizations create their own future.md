# Learning organizations create their own future

A learning organization is one that develops the ability to think systemically, resulting in generative learning that increases their capacity to create the future they seek.

> This, then, is the basic meaning of a “learning organization”—an organization that is ==continually expanding its **capacity to create its future**==. For such an organization, it is not enough merely to survive. “Survival learning” or what is more often termed “adaptive learning” is important—indeed it is necessary. But ==for a learning organization, “adaptive learning” must be **joined by “generative learning,” learning that enhances our capacity to create**.==[^1]
