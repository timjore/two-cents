# Resilience is the capacity to absorb shocks and retain function

Shocks to a system negatively impact the system to the degree that the system does not have the capacity to absorb shocks and retain its function. ==Resilience is **the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and still retain its basic function and structure**.==[^1] When encountering a shock or disturbance, the system’s response “depends on its particular context, its connections across scales, and its current state. Every situation is different; things are always changing. It’s a complex world.”[^2] In terms of [[Resilience Thinking embraces the reality that things change\|Resilience Thinking]]:

> Resilience is the capacity of a system to … ==undergo some change without crossing a threshold to a different system regime—a system with a different identity==. A resilient social-ecological system in a “desirable” state (such as a productive agricultural region or industrial region) has a greater capacity to continue providing us with the goods and services that support our quality of life while being subjected to a variety of shocks.[^3] 

Specifically, resilience thinking is focused on thresholds—the proximity of a system to a threshold and the complex forces that could drive it across a threshold.

> ==Resilience thinking is about envisaging a system in relation to **thresholds**.== Is it approaching a threshold beyond which it will be in a new regime? What forces—economic, social, and environmental—are driving the system toward this threshold?[^4]

[[Antifragile Systems become stronger with shocks\|Antifragile Systems]] are resilient systems that are not only able to absorb shocks and disturbances without losing basic functionality, but become stronger because of them.
