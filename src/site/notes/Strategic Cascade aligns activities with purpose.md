**PURPOSE**: Core "WHY" of the organization -the fundamental reason it exists (enduring)

- → Timeless, intrinsic, deeply rooted in values, inspires and guides decision-making at all levels

**OBJECTIVE**: Bold, ambitious objective that drives toward a transformative future (stable)

- → Specific, measurable, time-bound, pushing the organization to achieve its purpose (e.g., MTP, BHAG, etc.)

**PRINCIPLES**: Guiding principles, values, and policies that shape decision-making and strategy (stable)

- → Establishes parameters, standards, and priorities that shape how the objective is achieved

**STRATEGIC INTENT**: Big-picture vision and long-term goals that achieve the objective (3-5+ years)

- → Defines the organization's mission, direction, and positioning in light of principles

**TACTICAL PLAN**: Formulation of strategy as specific initiatives and resource allocation (1-3 years)

- → Defines how teams or departments contribute to strategic goals

**OPERATIONAL REALITY**: Execution of tactical plans through daily activities (weeks to months)

- → Ensures efficiency, productivity, and achievement of tactical goals
