# Understanding the systemic structure is powerfully generative

==Systems thinking provides the framework for observing **multiple levels of explanation in any complex situation**.== Senge describes three:[^1

**Events** (reactive)
↑
**Patterns** of Behavior (responsive)
↑
**Systemic Structure** (generative)


**Event** explanations are merely reactive to any event. Senge observes that this surface level of understanding “who did what to whom” dooms people “to a reactive stance. …event explanations are the most common in contemporary culture, and that is exactly why reactive management prevails.”[^2]

**“Pattern of behavior”** explanations focus on “seeing longer-term trends and assessing their implications. … Pattern of behavior explanations begin to break the grip of short-term reactiveness. …they suggest how, over a longer term, we can respond to shifting trends.”[^3]

**Systemic Structure** explanations are “the least common and most powerful. \[They\] focus on answering the question, “What causes the patterns of behavior?” … Though rare, structural explanations, when they are clear and widely understood, have considerable impact.”[^4]
