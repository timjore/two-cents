# Resilient systems require both specified and general resilience

A system can encounter two kinds of disturbances: those that can be anticipated, and those that cannot. Resilient systems must account for both of them.

> When managing for resilience you need to consider two types of resilience: ==resilience to **disturbances that you are aware of**== ([[Specified resilience defends against known disturbances\|specified resilience]]), and ==resilience to **disturbances that you haven’t even thought of**== ([[General resilience depends on diversity, modularity, and feedbacks\|general resilience]]).[^1]

It is important to note that “optimizing for one form of resilience can reduce other forms of resilience. … ==Managing for specified resilience is important, but so too is maintaining the general capacities of a social-ecological system that allow it to absorb unforeseen disturbances==—that is, general resilience.”[^2]
