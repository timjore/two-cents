# Large systems tend to disintegrate during development

The size of a system is correlated to the qualitative disintegration of its structure during development:

> ==The structures of large systems tend to disintegrate during development==, qualitatively more so than with small systems.[^1]

Conway argues that, “An activity called ‘system management’ has sprung up partially in response to this tendency of systems to disintegrate.”[^2] He traces the disintegration to three sequential factors that contribute to it:



1. ==Assigning **too many people** to the design==: “First, the realization by the initial designers that the system will be large, together with certain pressures in their organization, make irresistible the temptation to assign too many people to a design effort.”
2. ==Disintegration of **communication structure**==: “Second, application of the conventional wisdom of management to a large design organization causes its communication structure to disintegrate.”
3. ==Systemic **structure reflects the disintegration**==: “Third, the homomorphism insures that the structure of the system will reflect the disintegration which has occurred in the design organization.”
