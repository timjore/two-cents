# The clarity of a map is not easily distinguished from its accuracy

A map that is clear (and even beautiful) can be perceived as **more accurate than it actually is**. Subjective perception has encroached on objective reality.

By contrast, a map that is muddled, imprecise, and unattractive may be perceived as less accurate than it is, purely due to the negative subjective percpetion of the map.
