# Strategy formulation is an iterative process

The formulation of a strategic plan is logically linear, but practically nonlinear and iterative. The linear progression (winning aspiration → market segment → tactical plan → capabilities needed → management systems needed) is logical, but is only fleshed out over multiple iterations and movement between the different aspects of the strategic plan.

> It isn’t entirely easy to make your way through the full choice cascade. Doing so isn’t a one-way, linear process. There is no checklist, whereby you create and articulate aspirations, then move on to where-to-play and how-to-win choices, then consider capabilities. Rather, ==**strategy is an iterative process** in which all of the moving parts influence one another and must be taken into account together.==[^1]
