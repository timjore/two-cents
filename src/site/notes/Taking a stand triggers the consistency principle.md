# Taking a stand triggers the consistency principle

If someone makes a public, verbal, or otherwise tangible expression of a position, the consistency principle is triggered and they become more naturally inclined to align with the stand they have (inadvertently) taken.

> Once we realize that the power of consistency is formidable in directing human action, an important practical question immediately arises: How is that force engaged? What produces the click that activates the *run* of the powerful consistency program? Social psychologists think they know the answer: commitment. ==If I can get you to make a commitment== (that is, to take a stand, to go on record), ==I will have set the stage for your automatic and ill-considered consistency with that earlier commitment. **Once a stand is taken, there is a natural tendency to behave in ways that are stubbornly aligned with the stand**.[^1]

After assuring evaluators he wanted to answer all their questions as fully as possible, he added, ‘But, before we start, I wonder if you could answer a question for me. I’m curious, what was it about my background that attracted you to my candidacy?’ As a consequence, **his evaluators heard themselves saying positive things about him and his qualifications, committing themselves to reasons to hire him before he had to make the case himself**. He swears he has gotten three better jobs in a row by employing this technique.”
