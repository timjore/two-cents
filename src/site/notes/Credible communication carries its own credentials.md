# Credible communication carries its own credentials
  
_How do we make people believe our ideas?_ 

> **Sticky ideas have to ==carry their own credentials==.** We need ways to help people test our ideas for themselves—a “try before you buy” philosophy for the world of ideas. When we’re trying to build a case for something, **most of us instinctively grasp for hard numbers. But in many cases this is exactly the wrong approach.** 

Good communication **helps people believe** by ==appealing to **external credibility**== (both authority and anti-authority) ==and **internal credibility**==—by using convincing details, making statistics accessible, and using testable credentials.
