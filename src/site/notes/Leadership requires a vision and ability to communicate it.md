# Leadership requires a vision and ability to communicate it

“Leadership,” Sinek tells us, “requires two things: ==a **vision** of the world that does not yet exist and the **ability to communicate** it==.”[^1]

Absent either one, you have either a dreamer with no means to act on it, or a communicator without a sense of direction.
