# Disruptive innovation is antithetical to good management

Good management alone eventually results in organizational failure, for precisely this reason: merely doing all the right things for the existing customer base predisposes the organization to reject innovations that might disrupt them.

> … in the cases of well-managed firms such as those cited above, ==**good management was the most powerful reason they failed to stay atop their industries**== Precisely because these firms **listened to their customers**, invested aggressively in new technologies that would **provide their customers more and better products of the sort they wanted**, and because they carefully **studied market trends** and **systematically allocated investment capital to innovations that promised the best returns**, they lost their positions of leadership.[^1]
