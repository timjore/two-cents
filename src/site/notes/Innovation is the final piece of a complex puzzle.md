# Innovation is the final piece of a complex puzzle

Innovation is collaborative and collective, the result of choosing the right problem to solve in a context conducive to discovering its solution.

> Any major innovation or insight can be seen in this way. ==It’s simply the final piece of a complex puzzle falling into place==. But unlike a puzzle, the universe of ideas can be combined in an infinite number of ways, so ==part of the challenge of innovation is **coming up with the problem to solve**, not just its solution==.[^1]
