# Strategy narrows the competitive field

An effective strategy focuses on a specific field in which to win. The where-to-play and how-to-win questions from the heart of the strategy. The winning aspiration “broadly defines the scope of the firm’s activities; ==**where** to play and **how** to win define the specific activities of the organization—**what the firm will do**, and **where and how it will do this**, to achieve its aspirations.==[^1]

> Where to play represents ==the set of choices that narrow the competitive field==. The questions to be asked focus on where the company will compete—==in which **markets**, with which **customers** and consumers, in which **channels**, in which **product categories**, and at which **vertical stage** or stages of the industry in question==. This set of questions is vital; no company can be all things to all people and still win, so it is important to understand which where-to-play choices will best enable the company to win.[^2]

The where-to-play questions include those like the following which, when taken together, capture the strategic playing field for the firm.[^3]
- **narrow or broad?**
- **demographic segments?** (e.g., men ages eighteen to twenty-four, midlife urbanites, working moms)  
- **geographies?** (local, national, international, developed world, economically fast-advancing countries like Brazil and China). 
- **services, product lines, and categories?**
- **channels?** (e.g., direct to consumer, online, mass merchandise, grocery, department store) 
- **upstream, downstream, or vertically integrated?**
