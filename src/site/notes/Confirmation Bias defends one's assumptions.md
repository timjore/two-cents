# Confirmation Bias defends one's assumptions

Confirmation bias (or “motivated reasoning”) is the tendency to search for, interpret, focus on and remember information in a way that confirms one’s assumptions and preconceptions.

> In the most basic sense, ==confirmation bias prevents us from seeing possibilities that might challenge our assumptions==, and it leads us to gather, interpret, and recall information in a way that conforms to our previously existing beliefs.[^1]

In this way, confirmation bias is a passive mindset that leads to active (motivated) reasoning that further entrenches the bias.
