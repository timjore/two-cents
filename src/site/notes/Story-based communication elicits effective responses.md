# Story-based communication elicits effective responses
  
_How do we get people to act on our ideas?_ 

> We tell stories. Firefighters naturally swap stories after every fire, and by doing so they multiply their experience; after years of hearing stories, they have a richer, more complete mental catalog of critical situations they might confront during a fire and the appropriate responses to those situations. Research shows that mentally rehearsing a situation helps us perform better when we encounter that situation in the physical environment. Similarly, ==hearing stories acts as a **kind of mental flight simulator, preparing us to respond more quickly and effectively.**==  

Good communication **gets people to act**, **uses stories as simulation** (by ==visualizing, simulating problems, using stories as flight simulators==), and **uses stories as inspiration** (by ==means of ***challenge* to overcome obstacles**, ***connection* to get along or reconnect**, ***creativity* to inspire a new way of thinking**==)
