# Financial structure and organizational culture constrain disruptive innovation

Not only do the existing customers/users tend to constrain an organization to merely incremental innovation, the organization’s financial structure and organizational culture have powerful limiting effects on disruptive innovation.

> … it is not just the customers of an established firm that hold it captive to their needs. ==Established firms are also **captive to the financial structure and organizational culture** inherent in the value network in which they compete==—a captivity that can block any rationale for timely investment in the next wave of disruptive technology.[^1]
