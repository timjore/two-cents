- [[New organizations with range beat narrowly-focused incumbents every time\|have range across multiple domains and industries]]

- [[Typical organizational structures impede innovation\|implement an organizational structure designed for innovation]]
- work as part of a [[Intelligence is spread throughout decentralized systems\|decentralized]] [[Liquid Networks foster innovation\|network]]
- [[Emerging markets are decreasingly attractive as organizations get larger\|not be large]]
- [[Disruptive innovation is antithetical to good management\|not be optimally managed]]
- [[Efficiency is purchased by a loss in flexibility\|not be optimized for efficiency]]
