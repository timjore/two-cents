# Proximity to a threshold decreases the shock required to cross it

A system fundamentally changes when it crosses a threshold. When a system is further away from the threshold, it takes a greater shock to push the system over the threshold. Conversely, “the closer you are to a threshold, the less of a shock it takes to put you over it.”[^1]

A corollary observation is that ignorance of a threshold also increases the likelihood of crossing it:

> ==There is a **much higher likelihood of crossing a threshold into a new regime if you are unaware of its existence**.== This can easily occur because resilience (which … can be defined as the distance to a threshold) is a multi-faceted measure of a social-ecological system that changes over time.[^2]
