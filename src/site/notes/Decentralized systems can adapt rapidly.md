# Decentralized systems can adapt rapidly

Because of the pluricentric structure of a complex (decentralized) network, it is able to reconfigure rapidly to meet new threats and exploit new opportunities.

> The fourth principle of decentralization is that ==open systems can easily mutate==.  … As soon as an outside force presents itself, ==the decentralized organization quickly **mutates to meet the new challenge or need**==.[^1]

Principles of decentralization:
1. [[When attacked, decentralized systems tend to become moreso\|When attacked, decentralized systems tend to become moreso]]
2. [[Decentralized systems are easily mistaken for centralized systems\|Decentralized systems are easily mistaken for centralized systems]]
3. [[Intelligence is spread throughout decentralized systems\|Intelligence is spread throughout decentralized systems]]
4. Decentralized systems can adapt rapidly
5. [[Decentralized systems can grow quickly\|Decentralized systems can grow quickly]]
6. [[Decentralization of industries tends to lower profits\|Decentralization of industries tends to lower profits]]
