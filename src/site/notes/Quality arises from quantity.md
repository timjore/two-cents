# Quality arises from quantity

The **ideas of highest quality** tend to emerge from a **high quantity pool of ideas** (most of which are low quality).

> It’s widely assumed that there’s a tradeoff between quantity and quality—if you want to do better work, you have to do less of it—but this turns out to be false. In fact, ==when it comes to idea generation, **quantity is the most predictable path to quality**.== “Original thinkers,” Stanford professor Robert Sutton notes, “will come up with many ideas that are strange mutations, dead ends, and utter failures. The cost is worthwhile because **they also generate a larger pool of ideas— especially novel ideas**.”

Liquid networks create environments where partial ideas can connect:

> A metropolis shares one key characteristic with the Web: ==both environments are dense, liquid networks where information easily flows along multiple unpredictable paths.==...**Liquid networks create an environment where those partial ideas can connect**; they provide a kind of dating service for promising hunches. They make it easier to disseminate good ideas, of course, but they also do something more sublime: **they help complete ideas.**
