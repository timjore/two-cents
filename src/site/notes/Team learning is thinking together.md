# Team learning is thinking together

Team learning is the result of actual dialogue—the flow of ideas, knowledge, and innovation through a team, resulting in insights and solutions that are greater than what could be accomplsihed individually

> The discipline of team learning starts with “dialogue,” ==the capacity of members of a team to **suspend assumptions and enter into a genuine “thinking together.”**== To the Greeks *dialogos* meant a free-flowing of meaning through a group, allowing the group to discover insights not attainable individually.[^1]
