# Straight Line Instinct predisposes us to assume trends will continue

We tend to assume that linear progressions will continue far longer than they usually do. Most progressions do not continue in a straight line for long.

To control the straight line instinct, remember that curves come in different shapes.

- **Don’t assume straight lines.** Many trends do not follow straight lines but are S-bends, slides, humps, or doubling lines. No child ever kept up the rate of growth it achieved in its first six months, and no parents would expect it to.
