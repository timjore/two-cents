# Overcome loss aversion with hands-on experience

Loss aversion, the tendency to [[Loss aversion values avoiding losses more than achieving gains\|avoid losses more than achieving gains]], often combines with [[Ambiguity aversion favors the known over the unknown\|ambiguity aversion]] to create a powerful bias in favor of the [[Status quo bias favors the current state\|status quo]]. An effective way of helping people get past this is to give them a hands-on experience with a new possibility.

> ==People tend to resist new behaviors because they’re crystal clear about what they’ll lose by changing but uncertain about what they’ll gain==. When it comes to change, humans tend to overvalue what they’re losing while undervaluing what they gain. And ==no amount of cheerleading will allay the fears **as fast a hands-on experience**==.[^1]
