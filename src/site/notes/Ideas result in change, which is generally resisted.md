# Ideas result in change, which is generally resisted

The resistance to new ideas is essentially resistance to change:

> Even if your idea is undeniably brilliant, ==it will **force someone, somewhere, to change something**. Most people do not like change—they fear it.== And the qualities of your idea that you find so appealing may be precisely what make your idea so difficult for others to accept.[^1]
