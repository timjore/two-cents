# Dichotomous thinking simplistically resolves ambiguity

Dichotomous thinking (also known as “binary bias”) is ==the “basic human tendency to seek clarity and closure by **simplifying a complex continuum into two categories**.”==[^1] It attempts to resolve ambiguity by seeing things in binary, as **all black or all white**.

> ...**human beings are prone to dichotomous thinking. We don’t like ambiguity. We like things to be true or false, black or white.** When it comes to facts, this isn’t necessarily problematic, but alas it also applies to our opinions … **Because of this dichotomous thinking, most evidence that the world presents us isn’t overwhelming enough to compel us to completely shift our positions.** Therefore we stick with our original one. And that’s a shame because every time we do, we squander an opportunity to see the world more accurately, or at least more vividly.
> …
> **In order to be persuadable, ==we need to move from thinking in black and white to thinking in shades of gray==.** But practically speaking, how would this work? How do we actually learn and incorporate this grayscale style of thinking and thus acquire the edge that persuadable leaders have?[^2]

From *Think Aagain*:

> Hearing an opposing opinion doesn’t necessarily motivate you to rethink your own stance; it makes it easier for you to stick to your guns (or your gun bans). ==Presenting two extremes isn’t the solution; it’s part of the polarization problem.==
> 
> ==Psychologists have a name for this: binary bias. It’s a basic human tendency to seek clarity and closure by simplifying a complex continuum into two categories.== To paraphrase the humorist Robert Benchley, there are two kinds of people: those who divide the world into two kinds of people, and those who don’t.
