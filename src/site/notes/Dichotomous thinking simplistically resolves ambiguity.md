# Dichotomous thinking simplistically resolves ambiguity

Dichotomous thinking (also known as “binary bias”) is ==the tendency to attempt to resolve ambiguity by seeing things in binary, as **all black or all white**==, thus missing the complexities and nuance of the world as it is, which includes lots of shades of gray.

> ...**human beings are prone to dichotomous thinking. We don’t like ambiguity. We like things to be true or false, black or white.** When it comes to facts, this isn’t necessarily problematic, but alas it also applies to our opinions … **Because of this dichotomous thinking, most evidence that the world presents us isn’t overwhelming enough to compel us to completely shift our positions.** Therefore we stick with our original one. And that’s a shame because every time we do, we squander an opportunity to see the world more accurately, or at least more vividly.

> **In order to be persuadable, ==we need to move from thinking in black and white to thinking in shades of gray==.** But practically speaking, how would this work? How do we actually learn and incorporate this grayscale style of thinking and thus acquire the edge that persuadable leaders have?[^1]
