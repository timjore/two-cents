# Ambiguity aversion favors the known over the unknown

Humans tend to continue in a default course of action (or paradigm) even in the face of evidence that it is misguided because a course change requires shifting from an unambiguous context (the current path) to an ambiguous one (the unknown path).

> Quitting on something means not knowing exactly what will come next. This is so challenging for us because of ==a cognitive bias that behavioral economists call **ambiguity aversion**==. This quirk in our thinking ==causes us to **overly favor the known over the unknown**==, even if the known leads you or your enterprise to a disastrous voltage drop. This is why ==tolerance for uncertainty is important== not just when throwing your time and resources into something—it’s also necessary for pulling the plug.[^1]
