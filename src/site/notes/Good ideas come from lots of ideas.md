# Good ideas come from lots of ideas

Waiting until you have a good idea and hoping it arrives soon is fruitless. Good ideas invariably come from having many ideas.

> Linus Pauling, the only winner of two solo Nobel Prize awards in history, had this to say about finding ideas: ==“The best way to have a good idea is to **have lots of ideas**.”== … The lives of well-known creative thinkers were filled with compulsions for playing with ideas: they wanted wide landscapes to explore. ==Beethoven obsessively documented every idea he had==, madly scribbling them on tree trunks or on the manuscript paper he had jammed into his clothing, even interrupting meals and conversations to scratch them down.[^1]

Ideation can be an intentional activity (e.g., [[Idea quotas foster creativity\|Idea Quotas]]), but most often it is the serendipitous result of [[Big insights arise from idleness\|idleness]] and play.

> … ==It’s the willingness to **explore, experiment, and play,** to invest energy, hit a dead end, and then chase a new direction that allows minds to find good ideas.== All of our notions of play, and its freedoms from formal judgment, are inexplicably linked to finding good ideas.[^2]
