# Scenario Planning envisions the future

Scenarios are **alternate futures** in which today’s decisions may play out. Scenario Planning is a strategic planning method that ==combines **known facts about the future**== (such as demographics, geography, cultural, infrastructural information, etc.) ==as well as key **driving forces**== (identified by considering social, technical, economic, environmental, and political trends) ==to **imagine unwelcomed surprises**== that may disrupt the status quo, ==as well as **identify new opportunities**==.
