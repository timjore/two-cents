# Double diamond implements design thinking

> ==These two components of design—finding the right problem and meeting human needs and capabilities—give rise to two phases of the design process. The first phase is to **find the right problem**, the second is to **find the right solution**.== Both phases use the [[Human-centered design is the process of ensuring that people’s actual needs are met\|HCD]] process. This double-phase approach to design led the British Design Council to describe it as a “[[Double diamond implements design thinking\|double diamond]].”[^1]

> **The Double-Diamond Model of Design:** Start with an idea, and through the initial design research, expand the thinking to explore the fundamental issues. Only then is it time to converge upon the real, underlying problem. Similarly, use design research tools to explore a wide variety of solutions before converging upon one.[^2]
