# Changing things requires directing the Rider and motivating the Elephant

For most people, change is hard. In order to successfully bring about change, it is necessary to address both aspects of the human mind: the emotional side and the rational side. Psychologist Jonathan Haidt illustrates this by use of an analogy: “our emotional side is an Elephant and our rational side is its Rider. Perched atop the Elephant, the Rider holds the reins and seems to be the leader. But the Rider’s control is precarious because the Rider is so small relative to the Elephant. ==Anytime the six-ton Elephant and the Rider disagree about which direction to go, **the Rider is going to lose**. He’s completely overmatched.==”[^1] Neither aspect of the mind is better or worse than the other—they have complimentary strengths and weaknesses that must be accounted for.

> ==If you want to change things, **you’ve got to appeal to both**.== The Rider provides the planning and direction, and the Elephant provides the energy. So if you reach the Riders of your team but not the Elephants, team members will have understanding without motivation. If you reach their Elephants but not their Riders, they’ll have passion without direction. In both cases, the ɻaws can be paralyzing. ==A reluctant Elephant and a wheel-spinning Rider can both ensure that nothing changes. But when Elephants and Riders move together, **change can come easily**.==[^2]

In [[References/Switch – Heath and Heath (2010)\|Switch]], Chip and Dan Heath use this metaphor to suggest a framework for bringing about change when change is hard.[^3]
## 1- Direct the Rider  

- **[[Finding the bright spots clones what is already working\|Find the Bright Spots]]** – Investigate what’s working and clone it. 
- **[[Scripting the critical moves shapes specific behaviors\|Script the Critical Moves]]** – Think in terms of specific behaviors. 
- **[[Pointing to the destination shows why we're going\|Point to the Destination]]** – Show where you’re going and why it’s worth it. 

## 2- Motivate the Elephant  

- **[[Finding the feeling moves beyond merely knowing things\|Find the Feeling]]** – Make people feel something, not just know something. 
- **[[Shrinking the change reduces fear\|Shrink the Change]]** – Break down the change until it no longer spooks the Elephant. 
- **[[Growing your people cultivates identity and growth mindset\|Grow Your People]]** – Cultivate a sense of identity and instill the growth mindset. 

## 3- Shape the Path  
  
- **[[Tweaking the environment changes behavior\|Tweak the Environment]]** – When the situation changes, the behavior changes. So change the situation. 
- **[[Building habits reduces cognitive strain\|Build Habits]]** – When behavior is habitual, it doesn’t tax the Rider. Look for ways to encourage habits. 
- **[[Rallying the herd makes behavior contagious\|Rally the Herd]]** – Behavior is contagious. Help it spread.
