# Complex situations have multiple levels of explanation

Developing a systems perspective shows that there are multiple levels of explanation to any complex situation.

1. **Event Explanations** – Identifies “who did what to whom” (reactive posture).
2. **Pattern of Behavior** – Assessment of longer-term trends and implications (responsive posture).
3. **Structural Analysis** – Determines the structures causing the pattern of behavior ([[Generative learning requires systemic thinking\|generative thinking]])

> Event explanations—“who did what to whom”— doom their holders to a reactive stance. As discussed earlier, event explanations are the most common in contemporary culture, and that is exactly why reactive management prevails.
> …
> “Pattern of behavior” explanations focus on seeing longer-term trends and assessing their implications. …Pattern of behavior explanations begin to break the grip of short-term reactiveness. At least they suggest how, over a longer term, we can respond to shifting trends.
> …
 The third level of explanation, ==the “structural” explanation, is the **least common and most powerful**. It focuses on answering the question, “What causes the patterns of behavior?”== … Though rare, structural explanations, when they are clear and widely understood, have considerable impact.[^1]
