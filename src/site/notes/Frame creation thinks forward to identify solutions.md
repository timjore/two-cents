# Frame creation thinks forward to identify solutions

Frames that have been identified in the exploration of themes are explored in a forward-facing pattern of design abduction—to what extent does a given frame point to a future resolution of the problem?

> After a proposed frame is applied to the opened, broadened problem situation, it is then reshaped in a process of [[Coevolution simultaneously develops the formulation of and solution to a problem\|Coevolution]]. Through these investigations, ==we are seeking **assurance that the frame can potentially lead to realistic and viable solutions**. This is a “thinking forward” exercise== which is part of “design abduction” ... ==Only by proposing **both a pattern of relationships and a design** will we generate the feedback about whether we are on the right track in adopting a frame.== [^1]

Expert designers develop an intuition of the likelihood of a frame proving to be “fruitful.”

> Experts tend to talk about this process of proposing and trying out frame ideas in terms of “fruitfulness”: will a frame steer us in a promising direction, allowing us to generate multiple sensible solutions or not? ==Experts with years of experience will have built up an acute intuition about which frames will be fruitful and lead to results and which will not.== Without this kind of experience and gut feeling, the exploration of future scenarios can be very time-consuming. In parallel with the development of these ideas, we also need to develop a fledgling version of the value proposition for all of the parties involved. A frame and the solution ideas it generates are only as good as the interest and commitment they spark in the parties who are needed to implement them.[^2]

The [[Frame creation resolves complex problems in nine steps\|nine steps]] of frame creation:
1. [[Frame creation begins with investigation\|Archaeology]] – Investigate who has already tried what to solve the problem.
2. [[Frame creation requires understanding the core paradox\|Paradox]] – Understand the core paradox of the problem.
3. [[Frame creation learns practices and scenarios that may suggest a solution\|Context]] – Learn practices and scenarios that may suggest a solution.
4. [[Frame creation considers all stakeholders of the problem and solution\|Field]] – Consider all stakeholders of the problem and solution.
5. [[Frame creation seeks to understand the root factors of stakeholders\|Themes]] – Seek to understand the root factors of stakeholders.
6. [[Frame creation identifies common themes as the basis for frames\|Frames]] – Identify common themes as the basis for frames.
7. **Futures** – “Think forward” to identify solutions.
8. [[Frame creation develops a plan for transformation\|Transformation]] – Develop a plan for transformation.
9. [[Frame creation integrates solutions into the stakeholder context\|Integration]] – Integrate solutions into the stakeholder context.
