# The best plans maximize experience and experimentation

Good planning balances the tension between experience (things we know) and experimentation (things we do not know) with practical wisdom.

>  A good plan… is one that maximizes experience or experimentation; a great plan is one that does both. And the best plan? That’s one that ==maximizes experience and experimentation— and is drafted and delivered by a project leader and team with phronesis \[practical wisdom\].==[^1]
