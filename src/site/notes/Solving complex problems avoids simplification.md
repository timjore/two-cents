# Solving complex problems avoids simplification

Solving complex problems begins with embracing complexity. The human mind tends to resist complexity and use mental shortcuts to reduce it to something more manageable (e.g., the [[Availability Heuristic overestimates likelihood of events\|Availability Heuristic]]). This results in simplistic thinking that distorts or ignores available information that could be useful in solving the problem (e.g., [[Bed of Procrustes\|Bed of Procrustes]]).

> Another key feature of the frame creation process is its ==drive to move beyond the simplifications that often underlie conventional problem-solving, and take on the complexity of the world as it is==. This can feel quite counterintuitive: we tend to reduce the scope of the problems we face by introducing assumptions and framing them in a simple manner. Within frame creation, such assumptions that normally make life so easy are questioned, and the problem solver is invited to embrace the complexity of the situation. ==A major misunderstanding about the frame creation approach is that it contains some magic formula that makes problems easier to solve. On the contrary: **one of its major features is that it avoids simplification**.== It only helps the proponent to deal with complexity by providing a distinction between diverse layers of context, which limits the number of elements and relationships that need to be kept in mind at any one time.[^1]

Paradoxically, “==the frame creation approach **initially makes problem situations much more complex**==, before we can allow ourselves to converge on a solution.”[^2]
