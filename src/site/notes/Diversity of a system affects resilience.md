# Diversity of a system affects resilience

The degree of variation in a system is directly correlated to its ability to absorb shocks to the system. ==**Increased diversity provides increased flexibility**.== Increased efficiency leads to a reduction in diversity. Thus, increased efficiency results in decreased diversity which [[Efficiency is purchased by a loss in flexibility\|decreases flexibility]] and, thus, resistance to shocks.

> ==The more variations available to respond to a shock, **the greater the ability to absorb the shock**.== **Diversity**—variety in the number of species, people, and institutions that exist in a social-ecological system—**relates to flexibility** and keeping your options open. A lack of diversity limits options and reduces your capacity to respond to disturbances. ==Increasing efficiency (optimization) inevitably leads to a reduction in diversity.==[^2]
