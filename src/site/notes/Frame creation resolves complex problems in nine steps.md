# Frame creation resolves complex problems in nine steps

Dorst suggests that “the five problem-focused design practices … ([[Coevolution simultaneously develops the formulation of and solution to a problem\|Coevolution]], [[Developing problem situations allows reframing\|Developing problem situations]], [[Creating frames improves cognition\|Creating frames]], [[Exploring themes leads to solutions\|Exploring themes]], and [[Fostering a discourse shapes behavior\|Fostering a discourse]]) can provide a new angle for approaching … [[Challenges are now open, complex, dynamic, and networked\|open, complex, dynamic, and networked problems]]…”[^1] The process of frame creation involves nine steps:

1. [[Frame creation begins with investigation\|Archaeology]] – Investigate who has already tried what to solve the problem.
2. [[Frame creation requires understanding the core paradox\|Paradox]] – Understand the core paradox of the problem.
3. [[Frame creation learns practices and scenarios that may suggest a solution\|Context]] – Learn practices and scenarios that may suggest a solution.
4. [[Frame creation considers all stakeholders of the problem and solution\|Field]] – Consider all stakeholders of the problem and solution.
5. [[Frame creation seeks to understand the root factors of stakeholders\|Themes]] – Seek to understand the root factors of stakeholders.
6. [[Frame creation identifies common themes as the basis for frames\|Frames]] – Identify common themes as the basis for frames.
7. [[Frame creation thinks forward to identify solutions\|Futures]] – “Think forward” to identify solutions.
8. [[Frame creation develops a plan for transformation\|Transformation]] – Develop a plan for transformation.
9. [[Frame creation integrates solutions into the stakeholder context\|Integration]] – Integrate solutions into the stakeholder context.

> In the frame creation process, ==the oscillation between analysis and creation== that is central to creative design practice ==is intimately combined with a movement of zooming in and out== (from detail to abstraction and back again) ==and a shift in focus from an understanding of the core problem situation to widening the context, then to refocusing on the problem within a broadened field==. Central to these movements is the fifth step, where a kind of design-phenomenological analysis leads to the basic themes from which new frames can be created.[^2]
