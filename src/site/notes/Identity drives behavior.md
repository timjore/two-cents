# Identity drives behavior

When people make choices, they typically implement one of two decision-making models:

- **Consequences model** – “…assumes that when we have a decision to make, we weigh the costs and benefits of our options and make the choice that maximizes our satisfaction. It’s a rational, analytical approach…”[^1] ==The consequences model is extrinsically motivated and controlled by the rational, analytical left side of the brain.==
- **Identity model** – make decisions based on the perception of one’s identity, the situation in which a decision is required, and the pattern recognition of identity to behavior in this kind of situation. ==The identity model for decision making is intrinsically motivated (not analytical) but right-brained: perceptual and imitative== (e.g., “What would others in my identity group do in this situation?”).

> …when people make choices, they tend to rely on one of two basic models of decision making: the consequences model or the identity model. The consequences model is familiar to students of economics. It  ==In the identity model of decision making, we essentially ask ourselves three questions when we have a decision to make: Who am I? What kind of situation is this? What would someone like me do in this situation?== Notice what’s missing: any calculation of costs and benefits.[^2]
