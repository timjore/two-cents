# Antifragile systems are configured for adaptability

The key to designing antifragile systems is ==linking elements together in ways that allow them to reconfigure or adapt==. This requires shifting from predicting the (unknowable) future to reconfiguring for robustness. Said differently, the volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity of a complex environment is best navigated by a complex, interlinked network.

> Robustness is achieved by strengthening parts of the system (the pyramid); ==**resilience is the result of linking elements that allow them to reconfigure or adapt** in response to change or damage== (the coral reef).
>
> ==The key lies in **shifting our focus from predicting to reconfiguring**.== By embracing humility—recognizing the inevitability of surprises and unknowns—and concentrating on systems that can survive and indeed benefit from such surprises, we can triumph over volatility.[^1]
