# Institutions become committed to preserving the problem they were formed to solve

In order to perpetuate its institutional existence, an organization formed to solve a problem eventually (and unwittingly) becomes **committed to the preservation of the problem**—if the problem goes away, so does the organization.

> …an organization that commits to helping society manage a problem also ==**commits itself to the preservation of that same problem**, as **its institutional existence** hinges on society’s continued need for its management.==[^1]
