# Familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth

Authoritarian regimes and marketers have always known that exposure to a concept is directly correlated to the willingness of people to believe it.

> ==A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because **familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth**==. … If you cannot remember the source of a statement, and have no way to relate it to other things you know, ==you have no option but to **go with the sense of cognitive ease**==.[^1]
