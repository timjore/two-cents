# Everything we think we know about the world is a model

We are only able to interpret the world through models—maps that resemble and approximate reality, but are not reality itself. Meadows notes three important observations that ensue:

> 1. ==**Everything we think we know about the world** is a model.== Every word and every language is a model. All maps and statistics, books and databases, equations and computer programs are models. So are the ways I picture the world in my head—my mental models. None of these is or ever will be the real world.
> 
> 2. ==Our **models usually have a strong congruence** with the world.== That is why we are such a successful species in the biosphere. Especially complex and sophisticated are the mental models we develop from direct, intimate experience of nature, people, and organizations immediately around us.
> 
> 3. However, and conversely, ==our **models fall far short** of representing the world fully==. That is why we make mistakes and why we are regularly surprised. In our heads, we can keep track of only a few variables at one time. We often draw illogical conclusions from accurate assumptions, or logical conclusions from inaccurate assumptions.[^1]
