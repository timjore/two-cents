# Exploring themes leads to solutions

Within the context of a [[Developing problem situations allows reframing\|well-developed problem space]] and [[Creating frames improves cognition\|creation of a frame]] that illuminates cognition, the exploration of the theme is able to generate a [[Creative events bridge problems and solutions\|creative event that bridges the problem and solution]].

> ==Themes are a tool, a form of capturing the underlying phenomenon in a situation one tries to understand.== Themes arise from the need or desire to comprehend—they are ==the **sense we are able to make of a situation** when we approach it openly==, without prejudgment. The [[Creating frames improves cognition\|formulation of a theme]] is, at best, a simplification, helping us to distinguish a set of significant experiences and a deeper layer of meaning that underlies many observations.[^1]

This requires that the designer get as far into the situation as feasible, though their rationale for it and actions pertaining to it may be incomprehensible to others.

> Designers talk about “getting close” to the situation, they talk about the importance of “richness” in the problem area, and ==they stress the significance of getting “firsthand experience” of the problem situation== to build “empathy.” And yet they are quite vague about why they go to such lengths. Once they get into the problem situation, ==they seem to have no deliberate or systematic way of dealing with it. It looks as though they just hang around aimlessly.== We would argue that ==they are **observing clues** that could **lead to themes** which will help them **create a response** to the problem situation==. These clues are not explicitly expressed as themes, but are often packaged in episodic knowledge, as stories.[^2]
