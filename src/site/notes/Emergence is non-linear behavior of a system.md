# Emergence is non-linear behavior of a system


**Emergence** is the phenomenon where complex patterns, properties, or behaviors arise from the interaction of simpler elements, even though these properties are not present in the individual elements themselves. It is depicted in the phrase “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” 

**Emergent behavior** refers to the higher-order non-linear (unpredictable) behavior that arises from the interactions among the lower-order components of a complex system, rather than from the behavior of individual components. Thus, the emergent behavior of a system cannot be predicted from simply studying the component parts of a system.

> … ==in situations defined by high levels of interaction, ingenious solutions can emerge in the absence of any single designer==; prices can settle without a central planner; complex operations can be executed without a detailed plan.[^1]
