# People are more inclined to be influenced by multiple experts

A set of experts in agreement is more influential than a single one presenting what appears to be their own opinion.

> \[T]here is something I can recommend to enhance the impact of an expert’s advice—multiply it. ==**Audiences trust and follow the advice of a set of experts** more than that of any one of them== (Mannes, Soll, & Larrick, 2014). Thus, a communicator who does the work of collecting and then pointing to support from multiple experts will be more successful than a communicator who settles for claiming the support of just one.[^1]
