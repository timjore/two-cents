# Extrinsic rewards can crowd out intrinsic motivation

When intrinsically motivated people are provided with extrinsic rewards, it can stifle the intrinsic motivation.

> But when mission-oriented organizations try to use extrinsic rewards, as in promises of pay-for-performance, the result may actually be counterproductive. ==The use of extrinsic rewards for activities of high intrinsic interest **leads people to focus on the rewards and not on the intrinsic interest of the task**==, or on the larger mission of which it is a part. The result is a “crowding out” of intrinsic motivation: having been taught to think of their work tasks primarily as a means toward monetary goals, they lose interest in doing the work for the sake of the larger mission of the institution.[^1]
