# Finding the feeling moves beyond merely knowing things

Change only happens when people feel something.

> …==in almost all successful change efforts, the sequence of change is not ANALYZE-THINK-CHANGE, but rather **SEE-FEEL-CHANGE**==. You’re presented with evidence that makes you feel something. It might be a disturbing look at the problem, or a hopeful glimpse of the solution, or a sobering reflection of your current habits, but regardless, ==it’s something that **hits you at the emotional level**==. It’s something that speaks to the Elephant.[^1]

This suggests that the left hemisphere of the brain (which [[The two halves of the brain speak different languages\|tends to be more analytical]]) is more likely to prevent change by persisting in (over-)analysis, and **change is more likely to be driven by the right side of the brain** (which tends to be more intuitive and emotional). Perhaps it is for this reason that [[Divergent ideas come from the right brain\|divergent ideas come from the right brain]]. While feelings drive change, lasting, effective change is associated with positive emotions.

> Bottom line: If you need quick and specific action, then negative emotions might help. But **most of the time when change is needed, it’s not a stone-in-the-shoe situation**.[^2]
