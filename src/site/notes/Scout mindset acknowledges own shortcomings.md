# Scout mindset acknowledges own shortcomings

Paradoxically, one of the most telling signs of a scout mindset is a willingness to acknowledge situations in which the person has acted with a soldier mindset.

> ==But the biggest sign of scout mindset may be this: **Can you point to occasions in which you were in soldier mindset?**== If that sounds backward, remember that ==motivated reasoning is our natural state==. It’s universal, hardwired into our brains. So if you never notice yourself doing it, what’s more likely—that you happen to be wired differently from the rest of humanity or that you’re simply not as self-aware as you could be?[^1]
