# Planning is an active, iterative, learning process

Planning is most effective when it is positioned as the first step of *doing*, in an iterative process of experimental discovery.

> Planning, as I see it, is not merely sitting and thinking, much less a rule-based bureaucratic exercise of programming. It is an active process. ==**Planning is doing**: Try something, see if it works, and try something else in light of what you’ve learned.== Planning is iteration and learning before you deliver at full scale, with careful, demanding, extensive testing producing a plan that increases the odds of the delivery going smoothly and swiftly.[^1]
