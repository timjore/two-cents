# Elastic Thinking is parallel and integrative

Most patterns of thinking (especially as typically taught in [[Staging/Integrative, Macroscopic Thinking is antithetical to higher education\|higher education]]) are linear, singular and sequential. By contrast, the kind of thinking that leads to [[Shifting paradigms requires macroscopic, integrative thinking\|paradigm shifts]] is parallel (pursuing multiple—and sometimes [[Staging/Elastic Thinking can hold two contradictory ideas simultaneously\|contradictory]] —lines of reasoning in parallel) and integrative (seeing the systemic connections and processes).

> The process of elastic thought cannot be traced in an A to B to C fashion. Instead, proceeding largely in the unconscious, ==elastic thinking is **a nonlinear mode of processing in which multiple threads of thought may be pursued in parallel**. Conclusions are reached from the bottom up== through the minute interactions of billions of networked neurons in a process too complex to be detailed step by step. Lacking the strict top-down direction of analytical thought, and being more emotiondriven, ==elastic thinking is **tailored to integrating diverse information, solving riddles, and finding new approaches to challenging problems**. It also allows the consideration of ideas that are unusual or even bizarre, fueling our creativity== (which also requires analytical thinking so that we may understand and explore those new ideas).[^1]
