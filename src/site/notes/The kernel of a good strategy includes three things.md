# The kernel of a good strategy includes three things

The kernel of a good strategy includes a **diagnosis** of the challenge, a **guiding policy** for dealing with the challenge, and a **set of actions** that carry out the guiding policy.

> The kernel of a strategy contains three elements:
> 
> ==A **diagnosis** that defines or explains the nature of the challenge.== A good diagnosis simplifies the often overwhelming complexity of reality by identifying certain aspects of the situation as critical.
> 
> ==A **guiding policy** for dealing with the challenge.== This is an overall approach chosen to cope with or overcome the obstacles identified in the diagnosis.
> 
> ==A set of **coherent actions** that are designed to carry out the guiding policy.== These are steps that are coordinated with one another to work together in accomplishing the guiding policy.
