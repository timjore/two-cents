# Nothing is more perilous than introducing a new order of things

> ==There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to **take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things**.== For the reformer has enemies in all those who profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all those who would profit by the new order, this lukewarmness arising partly from fear of their adversaries…and partly from the incredulity of mankind, who do not truly believe in anything new until they have had actual experience of it.[^1]
