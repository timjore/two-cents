# Disruptive innovation requires plans for learning rather than implementation

Disruptive innovation is exploration that requires taking action before plans can be made, not implementation of clearly articulated plan. Thus, planning and executing a disruptive innovation is essentially a plan for discovery that [[Disruptive innovation requires plans for learning rather than implementation\|welcomes failure as learning]] and has high tolerance for ambiguity.

> But ==in disruptive situations, action must be taken before careful plans are made.== Because much less can be known about what markets need or how large they can become, plans must serve a very different purpose: They must be plans for learning rather than plans for implementation.[^1]
