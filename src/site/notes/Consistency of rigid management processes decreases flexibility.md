# Consistency of rigid management processes decreases flexibility

The very things that make a management process effective—consistency, control, resistance to change—reduce the strategic agility of the organization as a whole. When change is needed in order to survive, ==to the degree that the organization has optimized itself into an unchanging system, they are at existential risk.==

> One of the dilemmas of management is that, ==by their very nature, processes are established so that employees perform recurrent tasks in a consistent way==, time after time. To ensure consistency, they are meant not to change—or if they must change, to change through tightly controlled procedures. ==This means that **the very mechanisms through which organizations create value are intrinsically inimical to change**.==[^1]
