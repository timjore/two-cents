# Constant change requires constant reformation 

Circumstances are always changing, so ==even the system that is best-designed for a circumstance **must always be reforming**== if it is not to become calcified and ineffective over time.

> As conditions change the best approaches change—i.e., what  is best depends on the circumstances and the **circumstances are always changing**… For that reason it is a mistake to rigidly believe that any… system is always best because there will certainly be times when that system is not best for the circumstances at hand, and if a society doesn’t adapt it will die. That is why **==constantly reforming systems== to adapt well is best**. –Ray Dalio, *Principles for Dealing With the Changing World Order*, ch. 5, sec. “Conclusion.”

> If you leave a thing alone you leave it to a torrent of change. If you leave a white post alone it will soon be a black post. If you particularly want it to be white you must be always painting it again; that is, you must be always having a revolution. Briefly, if you want the old white post you must have a new white post. But this which is true even of inanimate things is in a quite special and terrible sense true of all human things. **==An almost unnatural vigilance is really required== of the citizen because of the horrible rapidity with which human institutions grow old.** —Chesterton, *Orthodoxy*, ch. 7
