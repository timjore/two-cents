# People judge the book by the cover

The adage “Never judge a book by its cover” exists because people invariably do, without even realizing it.

> ==People judge those dressed in higher quality apparel, even higher quality T-shirts, as **more competent**== than those in lesser quality attire—and the judgments occur automatically, in less than a second.[^1]

This phenomenon is easily exploited.

> Though more tangible than a title, the cloak of authority is every bit as fakeable. Police files bulge with records of con artists whose methods include the quick change. In chameleon style, they adopt the hospital white, priestly black, army green, or police blue the situation requires for maximum advantage. Only too late do their victims realize the garb of authority is hardly its guarantee.[^]
