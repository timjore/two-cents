# The two halves of the brain speak different languages

The two hemispheres of the human brain serve different functions in the human experience.

> We now know that the two halves of the brain do speak different languages. ==The **right** is intuitive, emotional, visual, spatial, and tactual, and the **left** is linguistic, sequential, and analytical.== While the left half of the brain does all the talking, the right half of the brain carries the music of experience. It communicates through facial expressions and body language and by making the sounds of love and sorrow: by singing, swearing, crying, dancing, or mimicking. The right brain is the first to develop in the womb, and it carries the nonverbal communication between mothers and infants. We know the left hemisphere has come online when children start to understand language and learn how to speak. This enables them to name things, compare them, understand their interrelations, and begin to communicate their own unique, subjective experiences to others.[^1]
