# Property rights locks up a decentralized movement

One of the most effective ways to neutralize a decentralized network is to introduce ownership of a scarce resource into the network. For decades, the Apaches (a decentralized network led by a plurality of catalyst leaders call Nant’ans) resisted the encroachment of the American settlers. What was it that finally broke their society?

> Here’s what broke Apache society: the Americans gave the Nant’ans cattle. It was that simple. ==Once the Nant’ans had **possession of a scarce resource**—cows—their power shifted from symbolic to material==. Where previously, the Nant’ans had led by example, now they could reward and punish tribe members by giving and withholding this resource.[^1]

Once people “gain a right to property, be it cows or book royalties, ==they quickly seek out **a centralized system to protect their interests**==. It’s why we want our banks to be centralized. We want control, we want structure, we want reporting when it comes to our money.”[^2] Property rights is one of the fastest ways to shift a circle from cooperative to competitive and turn a Catalyst into a CEO “stewarding” the assets of an institution.

> The moment you introduce property rights into the equation, everything changes: the starfish organization turns into a spider. If you really want to centralize an organization, hand property rights to the catalyst and tell him to distribute resources as he sees fit. ==With power over property rights, the catalyst turns into a CEO and circles become competitive==.[^3]
