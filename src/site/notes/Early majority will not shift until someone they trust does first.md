# Early majority will not shift until someone they trust does first

Between the Early Market (composed of a very few Innovators and only slightly more Early Adopters) and the Mainstream Market (Early Majority + Late Majority + Laggards) is a chasm—fundamentally different ways of viewing the world and making decisions about accepting new innovations. As Moore explains in [[References/Crossing the Chasm – Moore (2009)\|Crossing the Chasm – Moore (2009)]], to get from Early Adopters across the chasm to the Early Majority, a fundamentally different strategy is required.

Sinek explains:

> This is because ==the early majority … **will not try something until someone else has tried it first**==. The early majority, indeed the entire majority, need the recommendation of someone else who has already sampled the product or service. They need to know someone else has tested it. They need that trusted, personal recommendation.[^1]
