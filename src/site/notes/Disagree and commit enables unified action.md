# Disagree and commit enables unified action

[[Rough Consensus enables forward progress\|Rough Consensus]] is the goal of the team—everyone getting (at minimum) to the point where they are supportive of a given course of action, even if they do not agree that it is the best. “Disagree and commit” is the behavior required of each dissenting member of the team in order for rough consensus to be achived.

> Great teams avoid the consensus trap by embracing a concept that Intel, the legendary microchip manufacturer, calls “disagree and commit.” Basically they believe that ==even when people can’t come to an agreement around an issue, they must still leave the room **unambiguously committed to a common course of action**==.[^1]
