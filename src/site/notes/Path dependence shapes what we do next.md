# Path dependence shapes what we do next

The bias toward sticking with (or at least not deviating very far from) the [[Status quo bias favors the current state\|status quo]] is very strong. Varol observers that “**[[The default carries immense power\|The default carries immense power]]**... ==This idea is called **path dependence**: What we’ve done before shapes what we do next.==”[^1]

> If you had any doubts about our obsession with the status quo, take a look at all these idioms we’ve dedicated to avoiding change: “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” “Don’t rock the boat.” “Don’t change horses in the middle of the stream.” “Go with the devil you know.”[^2]

One reason for this is that the accumulation of knowledge—”the way we do things around here”—can have a paralyzing effect on disruptive innovation.

> But the same qualities that make knowledge a virtue can also turn it into a vice. Knowledge shapes. Knowledge informs. It creates frameworks, labels, categories, and lenses through which we view the world. It acts as a haze, an Instagram filter, and a poetic structure under which we live our lives. These structures are notoriously hard to beat back, and for good reason: They’re useful. ==They provide us with cognitive shortcuts for making sense of the world. They make us more efficient and productive. But if we’re not careful, **they can also distort our vision**.==[^3]
