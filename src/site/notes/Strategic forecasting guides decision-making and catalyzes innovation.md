# Strategic forecasting guides decision-making and catalyzes innovation

Strategic forecasting (or “strategic foresight”) is ==the process of **analyzing and predicting future trends, events, and developments** in order to inform and guide **strategic decision-making** and suggest **new innovation possibilities**.== It is a tool that organizations can use to anticipate and plan for future changes in their internal and external environment.

The process of strategic forecasting typically involves several steps, including:
- the identification of key drivers of change (aka “pre-foresight”, 
- the collection and analysis of data, 
- the development of scenarios and forecasts. 

The goal is to ==identify potential threats and opportunities==, and to provide decision-makers with the information they need to make informed choices about the future direction of the organization. Strategic forecasting can be applied to a variety of organizational contexts, including business, government, and non-profits. It is used to inform decisions related to long-term planning, strategic management, resource allocation, and risk management.

*Note: Strategic Forecasting is **not** the same as “forecasting.”* Forecasting is a managerial practice of calculating future supply and demand based on known data (“how many widgets can we make and sell next year”). Strategic forecasting is a leadership function that includes known data as a factor, but integrates broader trends through “horizon scanning” and [[Scenario Planning envisions the future\|Scenario Planning]].
