The process of strategic forecasting typically involves several steps, including:
- the identification of key drivers of change (aka “pre-foresight”, 
- the collection and analysis of data, 
- the development of scenarios and forecasts. 

The goal is to ==identify potential threats and opportunities==, and to provide decision-makers with the information they need to make informed choices about the future direction of the organization. Strategic forecasting can be applied to a variety of organizational contexts, including business, government, and non-profits. It is used to inform decisions related to long-term planning, strategic management, resource allocation, and risk management.
