Application: *When others fail, it is because they are losers. When I fail, it is because of adverse circumstances.*

> In a famous article, Stanford psychologist Lee Ross surveyed dozens of studies in psychology and noted that people have ==a systematic tendency to ignore the situational forces that shape other people’s behavior==. He called this deep-rooted tendency the “Fundamental Attribution Error.” The error lies in our inclination to attribute people’s behavior to the way they are rather than to the situation they are in.[^1]

> An even more potent bias in favor of stories of benevolent autocrats is called the “fundamental attribution error.” Demonstrated in many experiments, this error refers to ==the tendency of people to attribute an outcome too much to individual personality, intentions, and skill and not enough to external factors.==
