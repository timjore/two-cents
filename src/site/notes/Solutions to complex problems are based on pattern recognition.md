# Solutions to complex problems are based on pattern recognition

Frame creation begins with deep questioning of the initial problem situation, while searching for the associated patterns of causal behavior that may suggest a solution.

> To ground the frame creation process, we can restrict the scope of inquiry to understanding the pattern of actions that people have performed, and the direct occasion that sparked their actions. ==Frame creation is a practice that is based on **pattern recognition**==, and we need to pragmatically steer away from opinions or theories that people might hold about the world and about themselves. ==In the analysis and the creative steps of frame creation, **it is the patterns of behavior that are key**.== It is the deeds that count, not the words.[^1]
