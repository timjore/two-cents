# Bed of Procrustes

The [[Paradigms can have phenomenal longevity\|longevity of paradigms]] together with [[Ambiguity aversion favors the known over the unknown\|ambiguity aversion]] results in the tendency to force fit reality into paradigms that have outlived their usefulness. This is illustrated by the story of Procrustes, who was an inn-keeper in Greek mythology. ==In order to make the travelers fit in his bed, **he cut off the limbs of those who were too tall** and **stretched those who were too short**.== Either way, “he had the bed fitting the visitor with total perfection.”[^1]
