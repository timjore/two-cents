# Solving complex problems requires laying considerable groundwork

Problems that are most likely to benefit from utilizing a frame creation process tend to adhere to these patterns:

1. There are opposing views or conflicting aims.
2. No obvious solution is apparent.
3. The problem can be placed in an expanded context.
4. There is an open-minded champion within the “problem owner” organization that is seeking a solution.
5. Earlier solution attempts have not resulted in a satisfactory resolution, to the point where there is a willingness to take a different approach.[^1]

> ==When most or all of these conditions have been fulfilled, the frame creation approach still requires a lengthy process== of getting to know the problem, approaching actual and possible stakeholders, motivating them to participate, making contact with external expertise that may be useful, etc.[^2]
