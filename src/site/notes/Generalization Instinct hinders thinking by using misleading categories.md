# Generalization Instinct hinders thinking by using misleading categories

from *[[References/Factfulness – Rosling, et al. (2018)\|Factfulness]]*:

> Factfulness is … **recognizing when a category is being used in an explanation, and remembering that ==categories can be misleading==.** We can’t stop generalization and we shouldn’t even try. What we should try to do is to avoid generalizing incorrectly.

To control the generalization instinct, question your categories.

- **Look for differences within groups.** Especially when the groups are large, look for ways to split them into smaller, more precise categories. And …

- **Look for similarities across groups.** If you find striking similarities between different groups, consider whether your categories are relevant. But also …

- **Look for differences across groups.** Do not assume that what applies for one group (e.g., you and other people living on Level 4 or unconscious soldiers) applies for another (e.g., people not living on Level 4 or sleeping babies).

- **Beware of “the majority.”** The majority just means more than half. Ask whether it means 51 percent, 99 percent, or something in between.

- **Beware of vivid examples.** Vivid images are easier to recall but they might be the exception rather than the rule. (see: [[Availability Heuristic overestimates likelihood of events\|Availability Heuristic overestimates likelihood of events]])

- **Assume people are not idiots.** When something looks strange, be curious and humble, and think, In what way is this a smart solution? (But see also: [[Hanlon's razor avoids paranoia and ideology\|Hanlon's razor avoids paranoia and ideology]])
