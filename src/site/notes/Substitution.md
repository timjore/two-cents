# Substitution

When faced with a difficult question, we often **answer an easier one instead**, usually without noticing that we have done so.

> The question that the executive faced (should I invest in Ford stock?) was difficult, but the answer to an easier and related question (do I like Ford cars?) came readily to his mind and determined his choice. ==This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: **when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead**, usually without noticing the substitution.==

> If a satisfactory answer to a hard question is not found quickly, **System 1 will find a related question that is easier and will answer it.** I call the operation of answering one question in place of another substitution... **People are asked for a prediction but they substitute an evaluation of the evidence, without noticing that the question they answer is not the one they were asked.** This process is guaranteed to generate predictions that are systematically biased; they completely ignore [[Regression to the Mean\|Regression to the Mean]].
