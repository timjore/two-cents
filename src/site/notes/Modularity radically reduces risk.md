# Modularity radically reduces risk

A system that implements a modular design by linking the system’s components together is less likely to fail. This is because it will be better able to withstand unanticipated shocks (e.g., [[Black Swan events are rare, impactful, and retrospectively predictable\|Black Swans]]).

> It’s no small accomplishment to drastically reduce costs and boost speeds. But ==modularization does more than that; it **radically reduces risk**==—to such an extent that modularization may be the most effective way to “cut the tail,” as recommended in chapter 6.[^1]
