# Unexpected communication violates expectations
  
_How do we get our audience to pay attention to our ideas, and how do we maintain their interest when we need time to get the ideas across?_ 

> **We need to ==violate people’s expectations==. We need to ==be counterintuitive==.** We can use surprise to grab people’s attention. But surprise doesn’t last. For our idea to endure, **we must ==generate interest and curiosity==**. We can engage people’s curiosity over a long period of time by systematically “opening gaps” in their knowledge—and then filling those gaps.  

Good communication **gets attention** (surprise, by ==breaking patterns==) and **holds attention** (interest, by ==creating mystery, generating curiosity, highlighting a knowledge gap==).
