# Tools both illuminate and limit our understanding

It is easy to appreciate how a tool increases our ability to see more and understand things better. But we frequently fail to realize that ==the same tool is also the reason we cannot see further or clearer still==. A telescope enables us to see further into the universe than we otherwise could, yet it is also the reason we cannot see further stillâ€”it is both the reason for seeing further and the limitation on our ability to see.
