# Early majority is motivated by why rather than what

You can’t take new things and give them to the majority, because the status quo bias and loss aversion are too strong.

==The **early majority**—on the other side of [[Visionaries and pragmatists are fundamentally different in how they think\|the chasm]]—are motivated by “why” not “what” or “how.”==[^1] If you are attempting to tip the system, stop trying to convince people who do not want to be convinced and start shaping the conversation around why—the vision, the compelling purpose, etc.
