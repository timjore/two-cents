# Personal mastery is life in service of your highest aspirations

Personal mastery is the lifelong discipline of aligning the highest leverage factors of one’s life and being in pursuit of the things that matter the most to them.

> ==People with a high level of personal mastery are able to **consistently realize the results that matter most deeply to them**== … They do that by becoming committed to their own lifelong learning. … Personal mastery is the discipline of ==continually clarifying and deepening our **personal vision**, of focusing our **energies**, of developing **patience**, and of **seeing reality objectively**.==  [^1]

Personal mastery is achieved in the context of an effective commitment to lifelong learning. Thus, it is “an essential cornerstone of the learning organization ... An organization’s commitment to and capacity for learning can be no greater than that of its members.”[^2] Organizations that encourage the growth of their people in this manner make it possible for the team to tap into vast untapped resources that lay dormant in most organizations.
