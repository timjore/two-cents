# Disruptive innovations are underestimated for three reasons

Established organizations tend to conclude that investing aggressively in disruptive technologies is not a rational financial decision for three main reasons:

> - First, ==disruptive products are simpler and cheaper==; they generally ==promise lower margins, **not greater profits**.==
> - Second, ==disruptive technologies typically are first commercialized in **emerging or insignificant markets**==. And 
> - third, ==leading firms’ **most profitable customers generally don’t want, and indeed initially can’t use, products based on disruptive technologies**==. By and large, a disruptive technology is initially embraced by the least profitable customers in a market.[^1]
