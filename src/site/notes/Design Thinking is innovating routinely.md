# Design Thinking is innovating routinely

Design Thinking is “==a methodology for innovating routinely==.”[^1]

It implements an innovative problem-solving process:
1. fully **understand** the problem
2. **explore** a wide range of possible solutions
3. **iterate** extensively through prototyping and testing
4. **implement** the design and deploy the solution

> Coming up with an idea is easy. Coming up with the right one takes work. With design thinking, ==throwing out what you think you know and **starting from scratch** opens up all kinds of possibilities.==[^2]

Design thinking is ==**an innovative problem-solving process** rooted in a set of skills== that can be applied to any problem that needs a creative solution.

At a high level, the steps involved in the design thinking process are simple: 
1. First, ==fully **understand** the problem==; 
	- *Sometimes, **the problem you need to address is not the one you originally set out to tackle**... the actual problem is always broader, more nuanced, or different than people originally assume.*

2. Second, ==**explore** a wide range of possible solutions==; 
	- *"We **center the design process on human beings** by understanding their needs at the beginning, and then include them throughout the development and testing process" —Steve Eppinger (MIT Sloan)*
	- *Hold nothing back during brainstorming sessions — except criticism. **Infeasible ideas can generate useful solutions**, but you’d never get there if you shoot down every impractical idea from the start.*
	- *“One of the key principles of brainstorming is to **suspend judgment**,” Eppinger said. “When we're exploring the solution space, we first broaden the search and generate lots of possibilities, including the wild and crazy ideas."*

3. Third, ==**iterate** extensively through prototyping and testing==; 
	- ***Central to the design thinking process is prototyping and testing**... which allows designers to try, to fail, and to learn what works.* 
	- *“We don’t develop a good solution just by thinking about a list of ideas, bullet points and rough sketches,” Eppinger said. “We explore potential solutions through modeling and prototyping. **We design, we build, we test, and repeat** — this design iteration process is absolutely critical to effective design thinking.”*

4. Finally, ==**implement** through the customary deployment mechanisms==.
	- *The goal of all the steps that come before this is to **have the best possible solution before you move into implementing the design**. Your team will spend most of its time, its money, and its energy on this stage.*
