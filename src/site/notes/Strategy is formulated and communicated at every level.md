# Strategy is formulated and communicated at every level

One of the most common problems in organizations is the isolation of strategy to an elite group of “leaders.” The actual strategy of a team is not what is articulated on the “strategy document”, but is the aggregate of the strategic understanding of the entire organization, as evident in their priorities and actions. For strategy to be successful, it must be formulated and communicated at every level of the team.

> ==Strategy is **formulated at all levels of the organization**, and to be successful, it needs to be clearly communicated at all levels as well.==[^1]
